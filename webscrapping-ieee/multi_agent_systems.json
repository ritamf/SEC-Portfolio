Consequently, this paper discusses the possibility of proposing an intelligent strategic marketing via self-adaptive customer-oriented website. The idea is to provide a satisfying factor for visitors once they click and open a university's website page. The proposed framework consists of three main phases which are, e-questionnaire development, grouping society process, and tactical adaptation process. The first phase is achieved by conducting interviews with different people from different areas about their main concerns when they select a university and subsequently come up with an e-questionnaire. The second phase is operated by a multi-agent system that analyzes a society member's responses to the e-questionnaire and discovers the member's various preferences. The third phase is operated by a facilitator agent that performs tactical adaption to the website's content via a customer-oriented approach. The customer-oriented approach works on matching each group preferences with the website content. Finally, the self-adaptive website displays materials to these groups according to their preferences."}, {"id": "2", "title": "Near-Optimal Consensus of Multi-Dimensional Double-Integrator Multi-Agent Systems", "num_citations": "Papers (0)", "abstract": "In this paper, a distributed near-optimal method is presented for the consensus of multi-agent systems with multiple multi-dimensional double integrators.

Based on distributive and multi-intelligent agents design concept, and adopting ARM embedded technology, wireless network transmission, an intelligent monitor and protection system for the multi-tower cranes has been established. A multi-tower crane communication network has been set up to realize status information transmission of tower crane by adopting wireless token-ring communication. \u201cImplication Confirm\u201d feedback is used to speed up data transmission of communication network. Remote monitoring on working status of multi-tower cranes can be realized by using GPRS network. Field tests show the tower crane intelligent monitoring and protection system meets the requirements of monitoring construction safety of multi-tower cranes operating."}, {"id": "46", "title": "Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Consensusability of Linear Multi-Agent Systems", "num_citations": "Papers (486)", "abstract": "Consensusability of multi-agent systems (MASs) is a fundamental problem in the MAS research area, since when starting to design a consensus protocol, one should know whether or not there exists such a protocol that has the ability to make the MAS involved consensus. This technical note is aimed at studying the joint impact of the agent dynamic structure and the communication topology on consensusability. For the MASs with fixed topology and agents described by linear time-invariant systems, a necessary condition of consensusability with respect to a set of admissible consensus protocols is given, which is shown, under some mild conditions, to be necessary and sufficient."}, {"id": "47", "title": "A platform for dynamic organization of agents in agent-based systems", "num_citations": "Papers (0)", "abstract": "In most agent-based systems, different middle agents are employed to increase their flexibility. However, there are still three issues remain unsolved. In centralized architecture with single middle agent, the middle agent itself is a bottleneck and suffers from single point failure; middle agents in distributed architecture lack capability of dynamic organization of agents; The reliability is not strong because of the single point failure and lack of effective architecture. We introduce a platform with ring architectural model to solve all above problems. In the platform, multiple middle agents are dynamically supported for solving the first problem. For solving the second problem, middle agents dynamically manage the registration and cancellation of service provider agents and application teams, each of which includes a set of closely interacting requester agents to complete an independent task. Redundancy middle agent technique is proposed for solving the third problem. All middle agents are of the feature of proliferation and self-cancellation according to the sensory inputs from their environment. For organizing the middle agents effectively, a ring architectural model is proposed. We demonstrate the applicability of the platform by its application and present experimental evidence that the platform is flexible and robust."}]
