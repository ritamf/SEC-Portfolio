1|Radio propagation and wireless coverage of LSAA-based 5G millimeter-wave mobile communication systems|Papers (0)|Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications will be used in fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication systems, but they experience severe path loss and have high sensitivity to physical objects, leading to smaller cell radii and complicated network architectures. A coverage extension scheme using large-scale antenna arrays (LSAAs) has been suggested and theoretically proven to be cost-efficient in combination with ultradense small cell networks. To analyze and optimize the LSAA-based network deployments, a comprehensive survey of recent advances in statistical mmWave channel modeling is first presented in terms of channel parameter estimation, large-scale path loss models, and small-scale cluster models. Next, the measurement and modeling results at two 5G candidate mmWave bands (e.g., 28 GHz and 39 GHz) are reviewed and compared in several outdoor scenarios of interest, where the propagation characteristics make crucial contributions to wireless network designs. Finally, the coverage behaviors of systems employing a large number of antenna arrays are discussed, as well as some implications on future mmWave cellular network designs.

3|Radio Protection Area Estimation Methods for Spectrum Sharing-based 5G System|Papers (0)|The full-scale operation of the 5th generation mobile communication (5G) system was started in several countries. In Japan, in addition to the 5G nationwide public network service provided by telecommunications carriers, the local 5G (i.e., a private 5G network self-operated by various entities to flexibly configure and use a dedicated network within their buildings or premises) is attracting attention. As the local 5G systems become more widespread in the future, many local 5G systems will need to coexist in nearby areas. Therefore, estimating operational area of local 5G systems and avoiding interference between them will be important. Conventionally, the free-space propagation (FS) and the extended-Hata (EH) models are well-known as radio propagation estimation methods. However, they have problems to calculate the radio protection area from the interference and cause wasteful protection area setting or the lack of the radio protection. In this paper, we propose two novel methods for estimating the radio protection area to achieve both high spectrum efficiency and interference protection. In the proposed methods, the effect of single-knife edge diffraction is considered to the conventional models. The proposed methods are evaluated by using measurement results of actual radio propagation experiments in the campus field of Kyoto University.

We evaluated the 5G network co-channel interference over the fixed service, considering different number of cells, geographical location, propagation effects, antenna gains and antenna heights. The results show the separation distance requirements in order to deploy a 5G network without changing the fixed service.
5|Multi-layer 5G mobile phone antenna for multi-user MIMO communications|Papers (39)|In this study, a new design of multi-layer phased array antenna for millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) fifth generation (5G) mobile terminals is proposed. The proposed linear phased array antenna is designed on four layers of the Rogers RT5880 substrates to operate at 28 GHz which is under consideration for 5G wireless communications. Two identical linear sub arrays can be simultaneously used at different sides of the mobile-phone printed circuit board (PCB) for operation in diversity or multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) modes. Each sub array contains eight elements of very compact off-center dipole antennas with dimensions of 5.4Ã—0.65 mm 2 . The feature of compact design with good beam-steering function makes them well-suited to integrate into the mobile-phone mock-up. The fundamental properties of the proposed antenna have been investigated. Simulations show that the proposed 5G antenna is effective for the required beam-coverage in multi-user MIMO communications.

The peak gain of antenna is 8.2dBi at 38.75GHz and the gain is above 4dBi in the complete range of operation. Antenna is well suited for future 5G wireless networks with the flexibility to incorporate on planar surfaces like windows, doors etc. or can be made a part of non-planar surfaces like uniform or casual clothing.
8|Propagation channel characterization for 28 and 73 GHz millimeter-wave 5G frequency band|Papers (10)|The recent advancement in the 5G wireless technologies is demanding higher bandwidth, which is a challenging task to fulfill with the existing frequency spectrum i.e. below 6 GHz. It forces operators and researchers to go for higher frequency millimeter-wave (mm-wave) spectrum in order to achieve greater bandwidth. Enabling mm-wave, however, will come with various path loss, scattering, fading, coverage limitation, penetration loss and various different signal attenuation issues. Optimizing the propagation path is much essential in order to identify the behavior of channel response of the wireless channel before it is implemented in the real-world scenario. In this paper, we have analyzed the potential ability of mm-wave frequency band such as 28 and 73 GHz and compare our results with the existing 2.14 GHz LTE-A frequency band. We utilize the most current potential Alpha Beta Gama (ABG) propagation path loss model for designing urban microcell line of sight (LOS) scenario. We investigate the network performance by estimating average user throughput, average cell throughput, cell-edge user's throughput, peak user throughput, spectral efficiency and fairness index with respect to different user's capacity. The results express the significant improvement in spectrum efficiency of up to 95% for 28 GHz and 180% for 73 GHz is achieved in comparison with 2.14 GHz. It results also show that the 28 and 73 GHz frequency band is able to deliver up to 80 and 170% of enormous improvement in average cell throughput respectively as compared to currently LTE-A frequency band.

We emphasize at the end, the role of each atmospheric parameter on deteriorating the mm-wave signal, which will provide further insights about the phenomena discussed.
10|Multiple CATR Reflector System for 5G Radio Resource Management Measurements|Papers (0)|This paper presents a novel method using multiple compact antenna test range (CATR) reflectors to fulfill the Radio Resource Management (RRM) measurements required for 5G devices capable of beam-forming in the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency range. Four CATR reflectors are arranged on a vertical semi-circle with the device under test on a 3D positioner in the center of the intersection of four planar waves in order to generate five sets of Angular spreads, thereby capable of simulating multiple base-stations from different directions for mobility procedures and radio link monitoring of a 5G mmWave device. The reflectors create farfield conditions at the device under test so that large quiet zones of up to 30 cm in diameter can be measured in a compact setup. Measurements are performed with both CW and modulated signals in order to demonstrate the applicability of a multiple-CATR setup for simulation of multiple base-station RRM test scenarios.
11|Channel characterization for indoor environment at 17 GHz for 5G communications|Papers (1)|The increasing demand for the extremely-high capacity and connectivity in wireless communication systems has motivated the researchers to explore the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication. Owing to the wide bandwidth demand to increase the capacity, current spectrum bands below 6 GHz allocated for cellular mobile communication are congested and insufficient to support the services envisioned for 5G. Therefore, extensive on-going studies are investigating the feasibility to implement 5G systems at frequency above 6 GHz. In this paper, the propagation path loss at 17 GHz in indoor environment is characterized through series of continuous-wave channel measurements. Measurement results in typical Malaysian indoor propagation environment for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios are presented.
