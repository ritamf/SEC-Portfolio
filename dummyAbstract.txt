In this paper, the fault-tolerant formation control problem of a class of multi-agent systems is investigated, and a distributed active fault-tolerant control protocol based on sliding mode control method and fault estimation observer is constructed to reduce the influence of the fault. It can be proved that the control objectives of the system can be realized and a simulation result illustrates the effectiveness of the algorithm.
