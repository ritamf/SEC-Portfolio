# SEC-Portfolio

This repository contains the work done for the [Seminary of Computational Engineering](https://www.ua.pt/pt/uc/15302) course.

The goal of this work was to be able to perform literature review of abstracts from academic articles of a chosen subject, with the help of techiques such as web scraping, to collect abstracts and other data from articles, and NLP algorithms, namely lemmatisation, stemming, and most importantly, NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization). 

In the context of this work, it has been decided to do a literature review of MAS (Multi Agent Systems), but the developed code could be useful to analyse trends within any other field of study. For instance, by applying NLP algorithms in over 17000 abstracts of articles related to MAS, it has been possible to spot some trends within the field, such as smart grids, control, Lyapunov equations, Rendezvous problem, and ABM (Agent Based Modeling). These implemented algorithms may not give the most intuitive results, specially when unfamiliar about a certain subfield, but they can provide some insights about some relevant topics within a field.

The code developed in this project may be helpful in the future to do literature review about any subject, which is an important and relevant step for writting any article.
