Technologies like multi-agent system (MAS) have the capability to deal with future power grid requirements such as frequency management and voltage control under a flexible, intelligent and active feature. Based on web of cells (WoC) architecture proposed by European Liaison on Electricity Committed Towards longer-term Research Activity Integrated Research Programme (ELECTRA IRP), a distributed MAS with distributed negotiation ability for future distributed control (including frequency management and voltage control) is proposed. Each cell is designed as an intelligent agent and is investigated in case studies with constraints, where each agent can only communicate with its neighbouring agents. The interaction logic among agents is according to the distributed negotiation algorithm under consideration by the authors. Simulation results indicate that the WoC architecture could negotiate resources in a distributed manner and achieve successful exchange of resources by coordinating distributed agents. Moreover, the prototype reported in this paper can be extended further for future grids' distributed control regimes. The option of MAS to be exploited for the support of the development and integration of novel power system concepts is explored.
