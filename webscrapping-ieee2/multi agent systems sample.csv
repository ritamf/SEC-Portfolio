1|7379121|Conference Paper|2015|Moamin A. Mahmoud|A self-adaptive customer-oriented framework for intelligent strategic marketing: A multi-agent system approach to website development for learning institutions|In this paper, we argue that current universities'; websites provide essential information for visitors but they do not support strategic marketing issues. Consequently, this paper discusses the possibility of proposing an intelligent strategic marketing via self-adaptive customer-oriented website. The idea is to provide a satisfying factor for visitors once they click and open a university';s website page. The proposed framework consists of three main phases which are, e-questionnaire development, grouping society process, and tactical adaptation process. The first phase is achieved by conducting interviews with different people from different areas about their main concerns when they select a university and subsequently come up with an e-questionnaire. The second phase is operated by a multi-agent system that analyzes a society member';s responses to the e-questionnaire and discovers the member';s various preferences. The third phase is operated by a facilitator agent that performs tactical adaption to the website';s content via a customer-oriented approach. The customer-oriented approach works on matching each group preferences with the website content. Finally, the self-adaptive website displays materials to these groups according to their preferences.

1|9574653|Journal Article|2021|Qi Duo|Research on consensus of multi-agent systems with and without input saturation constraints|In recent years, with the continuous development of multi-agent technology represented by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm, consensus control has become a hot spot in academic research. In this paper, we put forward a discrete-time consensus protocol and obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the second-order consensus of the second-order multi-agent system with a fixed structure under the condition of no saturation input. The theoretical derivation verifies that the two eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the communication network matrix and the sampling period have an important effect on achieving consensus. Then we construct and verify sufficient conditions to achieve consensus under the condition of input saturation constraints. The results show that consensus can be achieved if velocity, position gain, and sampling period satisfy a set of inequalities related to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. Finally, the accuracy and validity of the theoretical results are proved by numerical simulations.

1|7379784|Conference Paper|2015|Osama Treef Alshaki|Development of spawning and mobility model for heavyweight software agent|Mobile agent technology has been implemented in many distributed computing domains and is becoming more popular. Several research have been conducted to address its challenges including two most important ones which are agent spawning and agent mobility. Solutions to such challenges include distributing tasks to other agents or migrating to remote hosts. In this paper, we discuss the issues of agent spawning and mobility and propose a new framework for dynamic spawning of agents, an alternative approach to the problem of local agent overloads. Agent spawning subsumes task transfer and agent mobility. Our paradigm entails that agents may spawn, pass tasks to others, merge or die. Spawning results in better software performance in terms of processing time, enhances efficiency of network utilization and reduce communication and computation loads.

1|7391702|Conference Paper|2015|Pegah Tabari Saadi|A fuzzy approach on consensus of nonlinear leader-follower multi-agent systems|A linear matrix inequality based approach for consensus of leader follower nonlinear multi-agent systems is discussed in this paper. A nonlinear multi-agent system is assumed, each agent and the leader has a nonlinear dynamic. It is assumed that at least one agent has access to the state information of the leader, Stability of the error dynamic is equal to consensus of the assumed multi-agent system. Then a fuzzy Lyapunov function is chosen, and some high dimension slack matrix are used, to decouple the Lyapunov';s matrix from the systems'; one and add some degree of freedom to the LMIs. Using some techniques, sufficient conditions for consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems are converted to LMI constrains. An example for consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems is solved to show the effectiveness of the main results.

The interaction graph among the agents is directed. A decentralized control law based on the relative output errors between the neighboring agents is proposed, and we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the Leader-following Consensus protocol. The numerical simulation results prove the theoretical results and indicate that the proposed consensus protocol is valid.
1|7162846|Conference Paper|2015|Yuge Zhao|Distributed consensus protocol for leader-following multi-agent systems with a Luenberger observer|This paper considers the consensus problem of the leader - following multi-agent systems. The dynamics of each agent are given in general form of linear system. The following agents can not obtain the state information of its neighbor agents directly, but the output information of its neighbor agents can be obtained. A function observer is proposed for each following agent to estimate its state feedback control input, and based on which a distributed consensus protocol is proposed to solve the leader-following consensus problem. Under the directed fixed topology, a consensus condition is established, and a multi-step algorithm is provided to construct the gain matrices and couple strength. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained result.
1|5228069|Conference Paper|2009|S. Ajitha|Predicting Performance of Multi-Agent systems during feasibility study|Agent oriented software engineering (AOSE) is a software paradigm that has grasped the attention of researchers/developers for the last few years. As a result, many different methods have been introduced to enable researchers/developers to develop multi agent systems. However Performance, a non- functional attribute have not been given that much importance for producing quality software. Performance issues must be considered throughout software project development. Predicting performance early in the life cycle during feasibility study is not considered for predicting performance. In this paper, we consider the data collected (technical and environmental factors) during feasibility study of Multi-Agent software development to predict performance. We derive an algorithm to predict the performance metrics and simulate the results using a case study on scheduling the use of runways on an airport.
1|7161682|Conference Paper|2015|Yuezu Lv|Adaptive output-feedback consensus protocol design for linear multi-agent systems with directed graphs|This paper addresses the output feedback consensus protocol design problem for general linear multi-agent systems with directed communication graphs. By proposing a new method called adding an extra observer, two novel adaptive output feedback consensus protocols are proposed to achieve consensus for any strongly connected directed graph. The proposed adaptive output feedback protocols are fully distributed, relying on only the agent dynamics and the local output information of neighboring agents. A sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed adaptive protocols is that each agent is stabilizable and detectable.

1|4740608|Conference Paper|2008|Maya Rupert|An Organisational Multi-agent Systems Approach for Designing Collaborative Tagging Systems|Collaborative tagging systems are an example of socially-aware, self-organising, complex systems. The multi-agent systems paradigm coordinated by self-organisation mechanisms has been used as an effective way for the design and modeling of such systems. Existing tagging systems do not take full advantage of their complex systems characteristics, especially in adapting to their environment and allowing emergence. In this paper, we propose a model for designing a tagging system, using a multi-agent system approach, governed by the co-evolution of the social and spatial organisations of the agents. We show how the proposed system has new functionalities that could enhance current collaborative tagging systems.

In detail, we develop a new framework to design an observer-based consensus protocol utilizing sampled data. That is, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence of sampled period for the robust consensus of MASs with connected and undirected structure. Finally, numerical simulations are also given to validate our proposed methods.
1|7379781|Conference Paper|2015|Muhsen Hammoud|A model of norms decay by agents' actions: Norms disappearance and norms collapse|In open normative multi-agent systems, norms are created dynamically. Some of these norms emerge and persist due to their benefits and strength. While other norms emerge for a short period of time, then vanish due to several reasons that lead to loss in their benefit or strength. Each norm of the created ones might have positive, negative, or neutral consequences on the system. Norms decay by society';s agents actions refers to the case in which a norm is not practiced or adopted by any of the society';s agents, and eventually deleted and forgotten. In this paper, we analyze the concept of norms decay by society';s agents. The results of analysis are used to propose two models which are: norms disappearance and norms collapse. Each model is explained and illustrated in a case study.

Unlike most existing works of finite-time consensus, we focus on nonlinear multi-agent systems with lower triangular subsystems. Based on the local cooperative information among neighboring agents, we propose a tracking consensus protocol ensuring that all agents achieve consensus in a finite time. Finally, we give an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.

2|9369162|Journal Article|2021|Li Bingqiang|Open-loop and closed-loop Dα-type iterative learning control for fractional-order linear multi-agent systems with state-delays|This study focuses on implementing consensus tracking using both open-loop and closed-loop Dα-type iterative learning control (ILC) schemes, for fractional-order multi-agent systems (FOMASs) with state-delays. The desired trajectory is constructed by introducing a virtual leader, and the fixed communication topology is considered and only a subset of followers can access the desired trajectory. For each control scheme, one controller is designed for one agent individually. According to the tracking error between the agent and the virtual leader, and the tracking errors between the agent and neighboring agents during the last iteration (for open-loop scheme) or the current running (for closed-loop scheme), each controller continuously corrects the last control law by a combination of communication weights in the topology to obtain the ideal control law. Through the rigorous analysis, sufficient conditions for both control schemes are established to ensure that all agents can achieve the asymptotically consistent output along the iteration axis within a finite-time interval. Sufficient numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control schemes, and provide some meaningful comparison results.
2|6661796|Conference Paper|2013|Mohamed Amin Laouadi|Towards an organizational model for Real Time Multi-Agent System specification|Over the last few years, several organizational models have been proposed in the literature for ensuring social order in Multi-Agent System (MAS) applications. Those models have considerably forwarded the domain by different paradigms to improving MAS development process. However, they have totally omitted real-time constraints, important aspects for Real-Time Multi-Agent Systems (RTMAS) construction. In this paper, we present a survey on MAS organizational models and an extension of AUML diagrams to describing Real-Time Multi-Agent Systems (RTMAS) organizational requirements. The proposed approach considers jointly functional, static and dynamic aspects of RTMAS. The aim is to combine the advantages of AUML and the organizational concepts extracted from the study of five agent organization methodologies in a single technique, since the analysis phase.
2|5228068|Conference Paper|2009|T. Amudha|A Multi-agent based framework for Dynamic Service Discovery and access using matchmaking approach|Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has gained recognition due to its reusable nature of applications and interoperability between heterogeneous technologies. The basis of SOA is the service whereas service is a self-contained software module that performs a predetermined task. The most important tasks in building a service-oriented application are the creation of services with coarse-grained functionality and the creation of interfaces with the right level of abstraction that enhances service discovery and access. Dynamic Service Discovery is one of the key issues of SOA that requires new avenues of research. Agents are reusable s/w components that provide controlled/shared access to services and resources and forms the building blocks with collaborators called as collaborative agents for applications organized across various networks. This paper proposes a novel approach for a multi-agent based dynamic service discovery using matchmaking technique.

2|6567818|Conference Paper|2013|Seyedehmehrnaz Mireslami|Automated verification of AUML based multi-agent system design|Industrial demands for agent-based software engineering have significantly increased in the past years. To detect and address the unexpected failures in early design stage of multi-agent systems, several methodologies have been proposed. Agent UML (AUML) is a methodology for agent-based software development that is an extension of the widely accepted UML. AUML handles the interactions among agents by extending UML in dealing with agent-based challenges. In this paper, Agent UML is employed for designing multi-agent systems. A set of conversion rules is proposed to convert Agent UML methodology into UML sequence diagrams that can be used for behavior model synthesis. Then, an automated tool is developed for multiagent system verification that can replace the existing adhoc methods. To validate the proposed methods, a case study of a Real-Time Fleet Management System is used.
2|9336858|Conference Paper|2020|YuZe Feng|Rapid Coverage Control with Multi-agent Systems Based on K-Means Algorithm|This paper presents a strategy for covering particles in a specific region with multi-agent systems. Previous strategies that study on partitioning regions, have struggled to cover complex regions. The proposed approach in this paper, based on k-Means algorithm, can partition particles in some complex regions and calculate the locations of agents which have limited range of detection. And then the agents can cooperate to monitor the whole particles. Simulation results show that the particles in different regions can be covered well by multi-agent systems based on k-Means algorithm.
2|6676519|Conference Paper|2013|Jeremy Pitt|Formal Models of Social Processes: The Pursuit of Computational Justice in Self-Organising Multi-Agent Systems|This SASO tutorial is concerned with the pursuit of computational justice in and for self-organising systems. We contend that many aspects of self-organisation in open systems and socio-technical systems -- such as representation in collective choice arrangements, fairness in resource provision and appropriation, rewards and sanctions for compliance and non-compliance with regulations, quality assessment of self-organised structures and processes --are all underpinned by some notion of justice. We propose computational justice as an interdisciplinary research programme at an intersection between computer science and social sciences, enabling and promoting an exchange of ideas and results in both directions. The aim of this tutorial is to provide students and researchers of self-organising systems with an introduction to the idea of computational justice, its motivation, concepts, tools, methods and applications -- and many open questions.

In other words, the agents have to acquire a pre-defined geometric shape and track a reference trajectory while maintaining the formation. The reference or disturbance signals are generated by an exo-system, which can be considered as an active leader or the environmental disturbance in the considered multi-agent systems. Based on the internal model principle, the formation control problem can be solved by solving the regulate equations. Finally, the illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the main results.
2|9164218|Conference Paper|2020|Tai-Fang Li|A distributed optimization algorithm for multi-agent systems with limited communication|In distributed optimization of multi-agent systems, agents usually cooperate to minimize a global function which is a sum of local objective functions. In this paper, distributed optimization of multi-agent systems is studied in which the global function is in a general form. A communication rule and a distributed algorithm are designed to solve the cooperative optimization problem of multi-agent systems with limited communication which is embodied by an undirected graph. The algorithm is designed according to the proposed communication rule which can share global information indirectly by transmitting information among the agents even though communications among the agents are limited, and is carried out through the true values of agents'; states instead of the estimated ones. A simulation example of distributed optimization of a four-agent system with limited communication is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

It is based on the idea that local environmental influences are constantly sensed by one or more of an agent';s senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.). The perception system is extensible and modifiable and allows users to dynamically modify how an agent perceives its environment at execution time. This paper focuses on the modularity of the agent perception architecture rather than the perception algorithms themselves.
2|8410510|Journal Article|2018|Heejung Byun|A Method of Indirect Configuration Propagation With Estimation of System State in Networked Multi-Agent Dynamic Systems|Networked multi-agent dynamic system (NMDS) exhibits emergent swarming behavior by using local control laws based on spatial information from the nearby environment and adjacent agents. One of the challenges in NMDS is the lack of appropriate methods for operators to interact with a large group of agents. Studies on human-agent interaction have mainly focused on the direct influence on the behavior of the multi-agents, but it is not feasible for a large-scale system in an error-prone environment. In this letter, a robust method for indirect configuration propagation by a human operator is proposed to influence the swarming behavior of NMDS in a decentralized manner. In addition, an estimation method is proposed for the operator to observe the system state, which helps the operator provide an optimal input to the NMDS at the appropriate time. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method through theoretical analysis and simulation results.
2|9316410|Journal Article|2020|Belkacem Kada|Distributed cooperative control of autonomous multi-agent UAV systems using smooth control|This paper addresses the cooperative control problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) systems. First, a new distributed consensus algorithm for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) is formulated under the leader-following approach. The algorithm provides smooth input signals to the agents'; control channels, which avoids the chattering effect generated by the conventional sliding mode-based control protocols. Second, a new formation control scheme is developed by integrating smooth distributed consensus control protocols into the geometric pattern model to achieve three-dimensional formation tracking. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability and convergence of both distributed consensus and formation controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through simulation results.

The multi-agent system consists of two subsystems that compete for maximum profit for their teams. Subsystems have no communication capabilities with each other. The status of an agent can only be identified based on its actions on the environment. In order to find an optimal solution we use a Nash Equilibrium concept of a non-cooperative game. The implementation of the system is done on a microcontroller. The evaluation of the Nash Equilibrium convergence rate was performed for 4 cases. The results are presented in the form of convergence charts.

3|8757768|Conference Paper|2019|Maobin Lu|Synchronization of a Class of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems|In this paper, we study the leader-following synchronization problem for a class of heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent systems with linearly parameterized uncertainties. The similar problem has been studied recently in some literature. Compared with existing works, our work has the characteristics in that the control law depends on the relative state of the multi-agent system. Thus, it can be adopted without communication of internal state. To solve the problem, we first introduce a class of distributed dynamic compensators, which depends on the relative state of the multi-agent system. Then, to deal with system uncertainties, we design the adaptive distributed control law. Finally, we show that the proposed adaptive distributed control law can solve the synchronization problem of the nonlinear multi-agent systems. The effectiveness of the main result is verified by its application to synchronization control of a group of Van der Pol oscillators.

A type of error convergence analysis based on Lyapunov function has been provided to prove the bounded convergence of the proposed consensus scheme. Finally, a simulation case is given to verify the effectiveness of the given event-based consensus control strategy.

Ramadan|Cooperation among independent multi-agents in a reliable data mining system|In recent years, data mining techniques has been used widely to address the problem of huge data sets stored on huge, heterogeneous data warehouses and may be located in different sites. Rapid growth of data arise in many areas like healthcare, social media, science, Internet...etc. Multi-agent technology has improved the processing of such huge data by the use of the agent technology along with data mining techniques in dealing with them.

4|7379124|Conference Paper|2015|Moamin A. Mahmoud|A multi-agent framework for funded research supervision|A supervisor';s delayed intervention on a student';s performance deficiencies seriously affects a research progress. Due to the demanding schedules of supervisors, it is a challenge for them to timely observe the performance deficiencies of the student. To mitigate this situation, we propose an agent-based system to enhance, control and manage the research supervision process. Specifically, the system is recommended for funded research projects as these research are subjected to penalties in case of failure. Four actors constitute the proposed system which are, a supervisor, a student, a system administrator and a software agent. Each actor has a role and is authorised to perform specific functions. An administrator can subscribe and unsubscribe members. Some functions of a supervisor include create and modify research milestones, verify a student';s new task and view a student';s progress. The system allows a student to view his/her progress, add a new task, upload a progress report and many other related functions. The main actor that facilitates the miscellaneous processes is the intelligent software agent. It manages the communication between a supervisor and a student, measures the performance and the completion, and tracks the different activities via alerting and reminding. In this paper, we highlight the pertinent issues in developing the framework.

4|7435727|Conference Paper|2015|Leo Raju|Advanced automation in energy management of micro-grid using multi agent system|The objective of this paper is to implement a Multi Agent System (MAS) in Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) for the automation and optimization in advanced distributed energy management of a micro-grid. We consider two grid connected micro-grids each contains wind turbine, solar Photo Voltaic (PV) systems and load. The power generated by solar and wind along with the load variations in the two micro-grids are calculated initially and then Multi Agent System is used for distributed energy management of micro-grid, which considers the intermittent nature of solar power, randomness of load, dynamic pricing of grid and variation of critical loads and automatically choose the best possible action every hour to optimize ther micro-grid. The advantages of MAS approach is leveraged through JADE to increase the operational efficiency and thereby maximizes the power production of micro-grid and minimizes the operational cost. Thus MAS in micro-grid obviously leads to economic and environmental optimization of the micro-grid due to its inherent features. Simulated operation of the micro-grids are studied by performing simulations under different agent objectives.
4|8929171|Conference Paper|2019|Kousuke Nishi|Modeling multi-objectivization mechanism in multi-agent domain|Many real-world tasks require making sequential decisions that involve multiple conflicting objectives. Furthermore, there exist multiple decision-makers, called multiagent, each of whom pursues its own profit. Thus, each agent should take into account the effect of other agents ` decisions to reach a point of compromise. For example, each agent decides with thought of other agents ` behavior in the decision of selecting the faster driving route to the destination, selecting a supermarket checkout line, and so on. For solving a sequential multi-objective decision problem, a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) approach has been investigated.However, current research on MORL cannot deal with the multi-agent system where existing agents are influenced one another. Therefore, in this study, we expand the conventional multi-objective reinforcement learning by introducing the idea of multi-objectivization with dynamic weight setting of other decision-makers. In an experiment, our proposed model with dynamic weight can express the cooperative behaviors that seems to be considered other decision-makers in the multiagent environment.

For example, autonomous computing, wireless sensor networks and robotics etc. It has several interesting results for clustering in data mining and Economics dispatch problem in distributed electric generation. A lot of theoretical analysis have been applied for such problems using consensus approach but still a practical approach to consensus based control of multi-agent systems is needed. This paper presents theoretical as well as practical systems for smart grid using consensus algorithm. Economic dispatch problem which is the major issue in smart grid is resolved through distributed consensus approach. For experimental purpose, a framework of Arduino IDE is selected for analysis, communication and simulation. Each Arduino board is an intelligent and autonomous agent that is in communication with all its neighbour';s nodes for adapting changes in demand and generation of power in Smart grid. Moreover, a dynamically changing behaviour of the systems is also in focus of this paper.
4|7162588|Conference Paper|2015|Jian Hou|Distributed multi-agent consensus with multiple group information|This paper studies the discrete-time system for multi-agent consensus problem via group information. In this scheme, neither the absolute states nor inter-agent relative states are available. We partition a group of agents into several subgroups in probability, and then use the relative group information to update each agent state. In this paper, we focus on the group information as the average value of the states of agents in the corresponding subgroup. It is shown that when the agents are divided into only two subgroups, almost surely consensus is achieved if and only if the weighting parameter is greater than one. While the subgroup number m = 3 is considered, one more condition that the partition probability to the chosen two subgroups should be equal is required to guarantee the convergence. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity of our results.

A valid control law for each agent is given based on the communication with their neighbors.

Finally, we give a simulation example to illustrate the validity of the theoretical method.
4|7052881|Conference Paper|2014|Hongyong Yang|Consensus of fractional multi-agent systems with disturbances|In this paper, a class of fractional multi-agent systems with external disturbances is studied. A pinning control strategy is designed for a part of agents of the multi-agent systems without disturbances, and this pinning control can bring multiple agents'; states to reaching an expected consensus track. A disturbance observers based control (DOBC) are developed for disturbances generated by an exogenous system to estimate the disturbances. Through fractional order system stability theory, a fractional composite controller for the anti-interference of multi-agent system is proposed, which will make the multi-agent systems with disturbance reach consensus asymptotically.
4|7814481|Conference Paper|2016|Alana Oliveira|An Analysis of Norm Processes in Normative Multi-agent Systems|The multi-agent system paradigm has proved to be very promising for solving complex problems because agents are able to behave autonomously and cooperate to achieve common goals without the need of a central authority. However, sometimes the need to introduce a control on a society of agents is observed in order to make them operate under a set of rules, as in a human society. Several studies have addressed the study of normative concepts in multi-agent systems, however there is a lack of an adequate systematization of life cycle stages and techniques to guide each one of them. This article analyzes the state of the art of norm processes in normative multi-agent systems.

4|9327673|Conference Paper|2020|Letian Li|Collision Avoidance Dynamic Window Approach in Multi-agent System|In multi-agent system formation switching, one common mission is to exchange positions of two agents. This scenario is prone to become a local minimum, since for each agent the direction to target and the direction of another agent movement are col-linear and opposite. Collision will occur if collision avoidance method fails to solve local minimum. Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) are classical collision avoidance methods. However, neither can be directly used in this mission. APF easily causes agent trapped in local minimum, which is unpredictable especially in dynamic environment. While DWA has collision avoidance term in objective function, inappropriate weigh parameters may block collision avoidance behavior. To cope with this mission, this paper proposes a new DWA variant called Collision Avoidance Dynamic Window Approach (CADWA). It is divided into collision risk detection part and collision avoidance part. Contributions of CADWA include: i) Neighbor set describes neighboring agents and its derivatives detect potential collision; ii) The objective function only focuses on reducing collision risk, so no local minimum will appear; iii) Besides preserving DWA merits like easiness to understand and fast reaction, CADWA does not need parameter tuning; iv) It is convenient to integrate CADWA into formation control algorithm which does not consider collision between agents. Details of CADWA algorithm are described. Simulation results show that two agents finish formation switching without collision.
4|7507094|Conference Paper|2015|Mohamed Hachem Kermani|A modeling of a multi-agent system for the protein synthesis|The progress of biological data acquisition technologies permit access to more massive, diverse, reliable, and less expensive data. The advent of these new technologies should provide to biologists, answers more accurate and more comprehensive. However, even if there are several work that revolve around regrouping and providing biological data for the biologists, there are still some issues to be studied; one of them is the integration of this biological information in databases and knowledge bases, in order to provide to biologists important knowledge allowing the characterization of the different causes of diseases. In this paper, we propose a modeling of a multi-agent system for the protein synthesis. Such a system will aim to synthesize, in an automatic way the proteins by exploiting the existing DNA sources, taking into account the dynamic behavior and the interactions that characterize the protein synthesis process. These proteins will be integrated automatically in a database, which will be enriched continuously as long as the sources of DNA exist. Such a database will be used by the biologists for several studies (medical, pharmaceutical, pathological, etc.).
4|6661737|Conference Paper|2013|Vineet Nagrath|HTM5-Trade Model for relationship based trade modelling in multi agent systems|Cloud computing and multi agent systems are two different but correlated flavors of distributed computing. Cloud computing is a business oriented model with efficient infrastructural usage as the prime focus while the multi agent system research is oriented towards the development of intelligent applications on distributed infrastructure. The commonality between the two appears when agents in a multi-agent system trade services with other agents. In recent years, model driven engineering is changing the way software is developed for complex distributed systems. Multi-view models are collection of models for a system under study, where every model is called a ‘view’ of the system and captures a different aspect of the design. Relationships are important aspects of multi-agent system design as agents are evolved from the concept of objects in object oriented modelling. The current work proposes a model for relationship based modelling of service oriented trade in a multi agent system. The proposed model may also be used to model intelligent cloud computing services based on multi-agent systems. The model is one of the 5 ‘views’ of a 5-View Hyperactive Transaction Meta-Model HTM5 and thus called HTM5-Trade Model.

Information and data exchange in heterogeneous data environment of the diverse market players are difficult due different data model and organization. This paper presents a bottom-up modeling approach of information exchange system for Nigerian deregulated electric power market using Multi-Agents System (MAS). To construct the MAS system, the functionalities of the agents, the interactions among the agents, and agent architecture are designed. A MAS for data communication based on the proposed architecture is an effective way of integrating heterogeneous data sources from the diverse players in the electricity market in Nigeria. MAS is well suitable for considering different scenarios of information exchange among market players as well as testing different requirements of information exchange in the electricity market.

Firstly, a rotating consensus definition is given in the real fields. To solve such a consensus problem, a distributed neighbors'; state feedback-based protocol is introduced. Then by employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, a sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for networks with time-delay is derived to make all agents asymptotically reach rotating consensus while satisfying the desired H∞ performance. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

In this paper, we study the problem of distributed containment control of a group of mobile autonomous agents with multiple stationary leaders under fixed directed network topologies and for each follower, there exists at least one leader that has a directed path to the follower. Z transform are used to study the multi-agent delayed system with discrete-time. Some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the containment of the first-order multi-agent system and a kind of control protocol was proposed for the second-order discrete-time systems with fixed time-delay. Finally, computer simulations show the effectiveness of the conclusion.

The multi-agent system as an advanced technology applied to build modern distributed control system was used. This paper proposes implementing a multiagent distributed grid control system for microgrids including grid, wind turbine, perovskite solar cells and several loads. Experimental results obtained on the Hardware-in-the-Loop physical model using Raspberry Pi was presented.
4|7545168|Conference Paper|2016|Jyh-Cherng Gu|Application of Multi-agent Systems to Microgrid Fault Protection Coordination|In conventional power systems, client-server architecture and centralized control are adopted for data acquisition and supervisory control, and the speed of message transmission and the fault responses is slow. In contrast, various types of distributed energy resources (DERs) with different characteristics and of different capacities exist in a microgrid system, and client-server architecture and centralized control are inadequate for control and operation purpose. In this study, an example microgrid system with a multi-agent system which complies with FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) standard is proposed and built using MATLAB/Simulink and Java Agent Development Framework (JADE). The operations of and among the intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), circuit breakers (CBs), calculation agent and CB agents in the example microgrid system for fault protection coordination under both normal and short-circuit fault conditions are analyzed and discussed. The results demonstrate that protection coordination can be correctly planned and control actions can be executed properly by the multi-agent system in the microgrid system, and the multi-agent system can isolate the fault area and protect the microgrid system in real time under varies conditions.
5|8122916|Conference Paper|2017|Kao-Shing Hwang|A shaped-q learning for multi-agents systems|This paper proposes an architecture where each agent maintains a cooperative tendency table (CTT). In the process of learning, agents need not communicate with each other but observe partners'; actions while taking actions. If one of the agents meets a bad situation, such as bumping onto obstacles after taking an action. In such a case, agents will receive a bad reward from the environment. Similarly, if one agent reaches a goal after taking an action, agents obtain a good reward instead. Rewards are used to update the policy and to adjust cooperative tendency values which are recorded in the individual CTT. When an agent perceives a state, the corresponding cooperative tendency value, and the Q-value are merged to a Shaped-Q value. The action with maximal Shaped-Q value in this state will be selected. After agents take actions and receive a reward, agents update their own CTTs. Therefore, agents could use this method to reach a consensus more quickly to enhance learning efficiency and reduce the occurrence of stagnation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can speed up the learning process and solve the problem of huge memory space consumption to some degrees. As well, it can make agents complete the task together more efficiently.

The traditionally applied collective problem solving in such conditions is ineffective, because by the time the agreed decision is made it becomes irrelevant. In this regard, it is necessary to develop informational intelligent systems capable of relevantly simulating the collective reasoning of experts and offering recommendations to the user of the systems, reducing the time of his reaction to events occurring in the control object. For these purposes, hybrid intelligent multi-agent systems of heterogeneous thinking have been proposed. In this paper, the use of the laboratory prototype of such a system to solve one of the problems with dynamic environment is considered, namely regional power grid restoration planning after large-scale emergencies.

A residual generator is designed by using a geometric approach. By defining the unobservablility subspace of the LPV multi-agent system, we design a set of residual generators which are sensitive to some actuator fault and decoupled from noise and other faults. Due to the fact that such residual generators only depend on the direction of the faults and noises and have nothing to do with the amplitudes of faults and noises, this method can be used to detect incipient faults, small faults and intermittent faults even with large noises. We bring forward a detailed algorithm to calculate the desired parameters. Finally, a simulation results on small satellites are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed distributed FDI algorithm.
