In this paper we propose the formalization of the stage design of our methodological approach M A MA-S S . This methodology allows the modeling of systems from the class of the distributed industrial problems, such as enterprise consortiums and virtual enterprises. The stage design of M A MA-S S  provides a multi-agent model of the system. It uses the organizational method RIO and its formal multi-formalism language OZS. The proposed formal model focuses on the decisional subsystem. We present three organization's definitions and the interactions between their composing roles. Thus we formalize and explain the abstract definitions required for the modeling of the agent organizations. Finally we focus on the trader role from the trading organization. The abstract definitions illustrate the formal modeling of the agents and their interactions with the agents' environment. The trader example highlights the modeling of an agent interacting with other agents
