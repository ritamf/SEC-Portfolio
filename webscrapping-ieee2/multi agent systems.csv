1|7379121|Conference Paper|2015|Moamin A. Mahmoud|A self-adaptive customer-oriented framework for intelligent strategic marketing: A multi-agent system approach to website development for learning institutions|In this paper, we argue that current universities'; websites provide essential information for visitors but they do not support strategic marketing issues. Consequently, this paper discusses the possibility of proposing an intelligent strategic marketing via self-adaptive customer-oriented website. The idea is to provide a satisfying factor for visitors once they click and open a university';s website page. The proposed framework consists of three main phases which are, e-questionnaire development, grouping society process, and tactical adaptation process. The first phase is achieved by conducting interviews with different people from different areas about their main concerns when they select a university and subsequently come up with an e-questionnaire. The second phase is operated by a multi-agent system that analyzes a society member';s responses to the e-questionnaire and discovers the member';s various preferences. The third phase is operated by a facilitator agent that performs tactical adaption to the website';s content via a customer-oriented approach. The customer-oriented approach works on matching each group preferences with the website content. Finally, the self-adaptive website displays materials to these groups according to their preferences.

Various categories of MAS communication models are also discussed. A profiling technique is also suggested for a multi agent system.
1|9574653|Journal Article|2021|Qi Duo|Research on consensus of multi-agent systems with and without input saturation constraints|In recent years, with the continuous development of multi-agent technology represented by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm, consensus control has become a hot spot in academic research. In this paper, we put forward a discrete-time consensus protocol and obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the second-order consensus of the second-order multi-agent system with a fixed structure under the condition of no saturation input. The theoretical derivation verifies that the two eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the communication network matrix and the sampling period have an important effect on achieving consensus. Then we construct and verify sufficient conditions to achieve consensus under the condition of input saturation constraints. The results show that consensus can be achieved if velocity, position gain, and sampling period satisfy a set of inequalities related to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. Finally, the accuracy and validity of the theoretical results are proved by numerical simulations.

1|6839545|Conference Paper|2014|Kazimierz Wilkosz|Utilization of multi-agent system for power system topology verification|The paper presents a modern solution of the problem of power system topology verification. Features of that solution are scalability, openness, flexibility and conformance to industry standards systems. In the paper, power system topology verification with the use of a multi-agent system is described. Different variants of the multi-agent system are considered. For those variants, a number of used intelligent agents is different. Modifications of the first variant of the multi-agent system lead to decreasing a number of the agents, which are taken into account, and at the same time to increasing system performance.
1|7379784|Conference Paper|2015|Osama Treef Alshaki|Development of spawning and mobility model for heavyweight software agent|Mobile agent technology has been implemented in many distributed computing domains and is becoming more popular. Several research have been conducted to address its challenges including two most important ones which are agent spawning and agent mobility. Solutions to such challenges include distributing tasks to other agents or migrating to remote hosts. In this paper, we discuss the issues of agent spawning and mobility and propose a new framework for dynamic spawning of agents, an alternative approach to the problem of local agent overloads. Agent spawning subsumes task transfer and agent mobility. Our paradigm entails that agents may spawn, pass tasks to others, merge or die. Spawning results in better software performance in terms of processing time, enhances efficiency of network utilization and reduce communication and computation loads.

1|7391702|Conference Paper|2015|Pegah Tabari Saadi|A fuzzy approach on consensus of nonlinear leader-follower multi-agent systems|A linear matrix inequality based approach for consensus of leader follower nonlinear multi-agent systems is discussed in this paper. A nonlinear multi-agent system is assumed, each agent and the leader has a nonlinear dynamic. It is assumed that at least one agent has access to the state information of the leader, Stability of the error dynamic is equal to consensus of the assumed multi-agent system. Then a fuzzy Lyapunov function is chosen, and some high dimension slack matrix are used, to decouple the Lyapunov';s matrix from the systems'; one and add some degree of freedom to the LMIs. Using some techniques, sufficient conditions for consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems are converted to LMI constrains. An example for consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems is solved to show the effectiveness of the main results.

The interaction graph among the agents is directed. A decentralized control law based on the relative output errors between the neighboring agents is proposed, and we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the Leader-following Consensus protocol. The numerical simulation results prove the theoretical results and indicate that the proposed consensus protocol is valid.
1|7162846|Conference Paper|2015|Yuge Zhao|Distributed consensus protocol for leader-following multi-agent systems with a Luenberger observer|This paper considers the consensus problem of the leader - following multi-agent systems. The dynamics of each agent are given in general form of linear system. The following agents can not obtain the state information of its neighbor agents directly, but the output information of its neighbor agents can be obtained. A function observer is proposed for each following agent to estimate its state feedback control input, and based on which a distributed consensus protocol is proposed to solve the leader-following consensus problem. Under the directed fixed topology, a consensus condition is established, and a multi-step algorithm is provided to construct the gain matrices and couple strength. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained result.
1|5228069|Conference Paper|2009|S. Ajitha|Predicting Performance of Multi-Agent systems during feasibility study|Agent oriented software engineering (AOSE) is a software paradigm that has grasped the attention of researchers/developers for the last few years. As a result, many different methods have been introduced to enable researchers/developers to develop multi agent systems. However Performance, a non- functional attribute have not been given that much importance for producing quality software. Performance issues must be considered throughout software project development. Predicting performance early in the life cycle during feasibility study is not considered for predicting performance. In this paper, we consider the data collected (technical and environmental factors) during feasibility study of Multi-Agent software development to predict performance. We derive an algorithm to predict the performance metrics and simulate the results using a case study on scheduling the use of runways on an airport.
1|7161682|Conference Paper|2015|Yuezu Lv|Adaptive output-feedback consensus protocol design for linear multi-agent systems with directed graphs|This paper addresses the output feedback consensus protocol design problem for general linear multi-agent systems with directed communication graphs. By proposing a new method called adding an extra observer, two novel adaptive output feedback consensus protocols are proposed to achieve consensus for any strongly connected directed graph. The proposed adaptive output feedback protocols are fully distributed, relying on only the agent dynamics and the local output information of neighboring agents. A sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed adaptive protocols is that each agent is stabilizable and detectable.

1|4740608|Conference Paper|2008|Maya Rupert|An Organisational Multi-agent Systems Approach for Designing Collaborative Tagging Systems|Collaborative tagging systems are an example of socially-aware, self-organising, complex systems. The multi-agent systems paradigm coordinated by self-organisation mechanisms has been used as an effective way for the design and modeling of such systems. Existing tagging systems do not take full advantage of their complex systems characteristics, especially in adapting to their environment and allowing emergence. In this paper, we propose a model for designing a tagging system, using a multi-agent system approach, governed by the co-evolution of the social and spatial organisations of the agents. We show how the proposed system has new functionalities that could enhance current collaborative tagging systems.

This paper investigates the robust consensus of a class of linear MASs with transmission noise. In detail, we develop a new framework to design an observer-based consensus protocol utilizing sampled data. That is, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence of sampled period for the robust consensus of MASs with connected and undirected structure. Finally, numerical simulations are also given to validate our proposed methods.
1|7379781|Conference Paper|2015|Muhsen Hammoud|A model of norms decay by agents' actions: Norms disappearance and norms collapse|In open normative multi-agent systems, norms are created dynamically. Some of these norms emerge and persist due to their benefits and strength. While other norms emerge for a short period of time, then vanish due to several reasons that lead to loss in their benefit or strength. Each norm of the created ones might have positive, negative, or neutral consequences on the system. Norms decay by society';s agents actions refers to the case in which a norm is not practiced or adopted by any of the society';s agents, and eventually deleted and forgotten. In this paper, we analyze the concept of norms decay by society';s agents. The results of analysis are used to propose two models which are: norms disappearance and norms collapse. Each model is explained and illustrated in a case study.

Unlike most existing works of finite-time consensus, we focus on nonlinear multi-agent systems with lower triangular subsystems. Based on the local cooperative information among neighboring agents, we propose a tracking consensus protocol ensuring that all agents achieve consensus in a finite time. Finally, we give an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.

2|9369162|Journal Article|2021|Li Bingqiang|Open-loop and closed-loop DŒ±-type iterative learning control for fractional-order linear multi-agent systems with state-delays|This study focuses on implementing consensus tracking using both open-loop and closed-loop DŒ±-type iterative learning control (ILC) schemes, for fractional-order multi-agent systems (FOMASs) with state-delays. The desired trajectory is constructed by introducing a virtual leader, and the fixed communication topology is considered and only a subset of followers can access the desired trajectory. For each control scheme, one controller is designed for one agent individually. According to the tracking error between the agent and the virtual leader, and the tracking errors between the agent and neighboring agents during the last iteration (for open-loop scheme) or the current running (for closed-loop scheme), each controller continuously corrects the last control law by a combination of communication weights in the topology to obtain the ideal control law. Through the rigorous analysis, sufficient conditions for both control schemes are established to ensure that all agents can achieve the asymptotically consistent output along the iteration axis within a finite-time interval. Sufficient numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control schemes, and provide some meaningful comparison results.
2|6661796|Conference Paper|2013|Mohamed Amin Laouadi|Towards an organizational model for Real Time Multi-Agent System specification|Over the last few years, several organizational models have been proposed in the literature for ensuring social order in Multi-Agent System (MAS) applications. Those models have considerably forwarded the domain by different paradigms to improving MAS development process. However, they have totally omitted real-time constraints, important aspects for Real-Time Multi-Agent Systems (RTMAS) construction. In this paper, we present a survey on MAS organizational models and an extension of AUML diagrams to describing Real-Time Multi-Agent Systems (RTMAS) organizational requirements. The proposed approach considers jointly functional, static and dynamic aspects of RTMAS. The aim is to combine the advantages of AUML and the organizational concepts extracted from the study of five agent organization methodologies in a single technique, since the analysis phase.
2|5228068|Conference Paper|2009|T. Amudha|A Multi-agent based framework for Dynamic Service Discovery and access using matchmaking approach|Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has gained recognition due to its reusable nature of applications and interoperability between heterogeneous technologies. The basis of SOA is the service whereas service is a self-contained software module that performs a predetermined task. The most important tasks in building a service-oriented application are the creation of services with coarse-grained functionality and the creation of interfaces with the right level of abstraction that enhances service discovery and access. Dynamic Service Discovery is one of the key issues of SOA that requires new avenues of research. Agents are reusable s/w components that provide controlled/shared access to services and resources and forms the building blocks with collaborators called as collaborative agents for applications organized across various networks. This paper proposes a novel approach for a multi-agent based dynamic service discovery using matchmaking technique.

2|6567818|Conference Paper|2013|Seyedehmehrnaz Mireslami|Automated verification of AUML based multi-agent system design|Industrial demands for agent-based software engineering have significantly increased in the past years. To detect and address the unexpected failures in early design stage of multi-agent systems, several methodologies have been proposed. Agent UML (AUML) is a methodology for agent-based software development that is an extension of the widely accepted UML. AUML handles the interactions among agents by extending UML in dealing with agent-based challenges. In this paper, Agent UML is employed for designing multi-agent systems. A set of conversion rules is proposed to convert Agent UML methodology into UML sequence diagrams that can be used for behavior model synthesis. Then, an automated tool is developed for multiagent system verification that can replace the existing adhoc methods. To validate the proposed methods, a case study of a Real-Time Fleet Management System is used.
2|9336858|Conference Paper|2020|YuZe Feng|Rapid Coverage Control with Multi-agent Systems Based on K-Means Algorithm|This paper presents a strategy for covering particles in a specific region with multi-agent systems. Previous strategies that study on partitioning regions, have struggled to cover complex regions. The proposed approach in this paper, based on k-Means algorithm, can partition particles in some complex regions and calculate the locations of agents which have limited range of detection. And then the agents can cooperate to monitor the whole particles. Simulation results show that the particles in different regions can be covered well by multi-agent systems based on k-Means algorithm.

The abstract definitions illustrate the formal modeling of the agents and their interactions with the agents'; environment. The trader example highlights the modeling of an agent interacting with other agents
2|6676519|Conference Paper|2013|Jeremy Pitt|Formal Models of Social Processes: The Pursuit of Computational Justice in Self-Organising Multi-Agent Systems|This SASO tutorial is concerned with the pursuit of computational justice in and for self-organising systems. We contend that many aspects of self-organisation in open systems and socio-technical systems -- such as representation in collective choice arrangements, fairness in resource provision and appropriation, rewards and sanctions for compliance and non-compliance with regulations, quality assessment of self-organised structures and processes --are all underpinned by some notion of justice. We propose computational justice as an interdisciplinary research programme at an intersection between computer science and social sciences, enabling and promoting an exchange of ideas and results in both directions. The aim of this tutorial is to provide students and researchers of self-organising systems with an introduction to the idea of computational justice, its motivation, concepts, tools, methods and applications -- and many open questions.

2|6640680|Conference Paper|2013|Weixun Li|A novel formation control for multi-agent systems by nonlinear output regulation|In this paper, the formation control problem of multi-agent systems with affine nonlinear dynamic is considered. In other words, the agents have to acquire a pre-defined geometric shape and track a reference trajectory while maintaining the formation. The reference or disturbance signals are generated by an exo-system, which can be considered as an active leader or the environmental disturbance in the considered multi-agent systems. Based on the internal model principle, the formation control problem can be solved by solving the regulate equations. Finally, the illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the main results.
2|9164218|Conference Paper|2020|Tai-Fang Li|A distributed optimization algorithm for multi-agent systems with limited communication|In distributed optimization of multi-agent systems, agents usually cooperate to minimize a global function which is a sum of local objective functions. In this paper, distributed optimization of multi-agent systems is studied in which the global function is in a general form. A communication rule and a distributed algorithm are designed to solve the cooperative optimization problem of multi-agent systems with limited communication which is embodied by an undirected graph. The algorithm is designed according to the proposed communication rule which can share global information indirectly by transmitting information among the agents even though communications among the agents are limited, and is carried out through the true values of agents'; states instead of the estimated ones. A simulation example of distributed optimization of a four-agent system with limited communication is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

One of the challenges in NMDS is the lack of appropriate methods for operators to interact with a large group of agents. Studies on human-agent interaction have mainly focused on the direct influence on the behavior of the multi-agents, but it is not feasible for a large-scale system in an error-prone environment. In this letter, a robust method for indirect configuration propagation by a human operator is proposed to influence the swarming behavior of NMDS in a decentralized manner. In addition, an estimation method is proposed for the operator to observe the system state, which helps the operator provide an optimal input to the NMDS at the appropriate time. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method through theoretical analysis and simulation results.
2|9316410|Journal Article|2020|Belkacem Kada|Distributed cooperative control of autonomous multi-agent UAV systems using smooth control|This paper addresses the cooperative control problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) systems. First, a new distributed consensus algorithm for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) is formulated under the leader-following approach. The algorithm provides smooth input signals to the agents'; control channels, which avoids the chattering effect generated by the conventional sliding mode-based control protocols. Second, a new formation control scheme is developed by integrating smooth distributed consensus control protocols into the geometric pattern model to achieve three-dimensional formation tracking. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability and convergence of both distributed consensus and formation controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through simulation results.

In this paper we present the design of a multi-agent system with cognitive properties meant to find optimal solution according to the game theory. The multi-agent system consists of two subsystems that compete for maximum profit for their teams. Subsystems have no communication capabilities with each other. The status of an agent can only be identified based on its actions on the environment. In order to find an optimal solution we use a Nash Equilibrium concept of a non-cooperative game. The implementation of the system is done on a microcontroller. The evaluation of the Nash Equilibrium convergence rate was performed for 4 cases. The results are presented in the form of convergence charts.

3|8757768|Conference Paper|2019|Maobin Lu|Synchronization of a Class of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems|In this paper, we study the leader-following synchronization problem for a class of heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent systems with linearly parameterized uncertainties. The similar problem has been studied recently in some literature. Compared with existing works, our work has the characteristics in that the control law depends on the relative state of the multi-agent system. Thus, it can be adopted without communication of internal state. To solve the problem, we first introduce a class of distributed dynamic compensators, which depends on the relative state of the multi-agent system. Then, to deal with system uncertainties, we design the adaptive distributed control law. Finally, we show that the proposed adaptive distributed control law can solve the synchronization problem of the nonlinear multi-agent systems. The effectiveness of the main result is verified by its application to synchronization control of a group of Van der Pol oscillators.

Finally, a simulation case is given to verify the effectiveness of the given event-based consensus control strategy.

4|7379124|Conference Paper|2015|Moamin A. Mahmoud|A multi-agent framework for funded research supervision|A supervisor';s delayed intervention on a student';s performance deficiencies seriously affects a research progress. Due to the demanding schedules of supervisors, it is a challenge for them to timely observe the performance deficiencies of the student. To mitigate this situation, we propose an agent-based system to enhance, control and manage the research supervision process. Specifically, the system is recommended for funded research projects as these research are subjected to penalties in case of failure. Four actors constitute the proposed system which are, a supervisor, a student, a system administrator and a software agent. Each actor has a role and is authorised to perform specific functions. An administrator can subscribe and unsubscribe members. Some functions of a supervisor include create and modify research milestones, verify a student';s new task and view a student';s progress. The system allows a student to view his/her progress, add a new task, upload a progress report and many other related functions. The main actor that facilitates the miscellaneous processes is the intelligent software agent. It manages the communication between a supervisor and a student, measures the performance and the completion, and tracks the different activities via alerting and reminding. In this paper, we highlight the pertinent issues in developing the framework.

4|7435727|Conference Paper|2015|Leo Raju|Advanced automation in energy management of micro-grid using multi agent system|The objective of this paper is to implement a Multi Agent System (MAS) in Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) for the automation and optimization in advanced distributed energy management of a micro-grid. We consider two grid connected micro-grids each contains wind turbine, solar Photo Voltaic (PV) systems and load. The power generated by solar and wind along with the load variations in the two micro-grids are calculated initially and then Multi Agent System is used for distributed energy management of micro-grid, which considers the intermittent nature of solar power, randomness of load, dynamic pricing of grid and variation of critical loads and automatically choose the best possible action every hour to optimize ther micro-grid. The advantages of MAS approach is leveraged through JADE to increase the operational efficiency and thereby maximizes the power production of micro-grid and minimizes the operational cost. Thus MAS in micro-grid obviously leads to economic and environmental optimization of the micro-grid due to its inherent features. Simulated operation of the micro-grids are studied by performing simulations under different agent objectives.
4|8929171|Conference Paper|2019|Kousuke Nishi|Modeling multi-objectivization mechanism in multi-agent domain|Many real-world tasks require making sequential decisions that involve multiple conflicting objectives. Furthermore, there exist multiple decision-makers, called multiagent, each of whom pursues its own profit. Thus, each agent should take into account the effect of other agents ` decisions to reach a point of compromise. For example, each agent decides with thought of other agents ` behavior in the decision of selecting the faster driving route to the destination, selecting a supermarket checkout line, and so on. For solving a sequential multi-objective decision problem, a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) approach has been investigated.However, current research on MORL cannot deal with the multi-agent system where existing agents are influenced one another. Therefore, in this study, we expand the conventional multi-objective reinforcement learning by introducing the idea of multi-objectivization with dynamic weight setting of other decision-makers. In an experiment, our proposed model with dynamic weight can express the cooperative behaviors that seems to be considered other decision-makers in the multiagent environment.

Moreover, a dynamically changing behaviour of the systems is also in focus of this paper.
4|7162588|Conference Paper|2015|Jian Hou|Distributed multi-agent consensus with multiple group information|This paper studies the discrete-time system for multi-agent consensus problem via group information. In this scheme, neither the absolute states nor inter-agent relative states are available. We partition a group of agents into several subgroups in probability, and then use the relative group information to update each agent state. In this paper, we focus on the group information as the average value of the states of agents in the corresponding subgroup. It is shown that when the agents are divided into only two subgroups, almost surely consensus is achieved if and only if the weighting parameter is greater than one. While the subgroup number m = 3 is considered, one more condition that the partition probability to the chosen two subgroups should be equal is required to guarantee the convergence. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity of our results.

Through fractional order system stability theory, a fractional composite controller for the anti-interference of multi-agent system is proposed, which will make the multi-agent systems with disturbance reach consensus asymptotically.
4|7814481|Conference Paper|2016|Alana Oliveira|An Analysis of Norm Processes in Normative Multi-agent Systems|The multi-agent system paradigm has proved to be very promising for solving complex problems because agents are able to behave autonomously and cooperate to achieve common goals without the need of a central authority. However, sometimes the need to introduce a control on a society of agents is observed in order to make them operate under a set of rules, as in a human society. Several studies have addressed the study of normative concepts in multi-agent systems, however there is a lack of an adequate systematization of life cycle stages and techniques to guide each one of them. This article analyzes the state of the art of norm processes in normative multi-agent systems.

4|9327673|Conference Paper|2020|Letian Li|Collision Avoidance Dynamic Window Approach in Multi-agent System|In multi-agent system formation switching, one common mission is to exchange positions of two agents. This scenario is prone to become a local minimum, since for each agent the direction to target and the direction of another agent movement are col-linear and opposite. Collision will occur if collision avoidance method fails to solve local minimum. Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) are classical collision avoidance methods. However, neither can be directly used in this mission. APF easily causes agent trapped in local minimum, which is unpredictable especially in dynamic environment. While DWA has collision avoidance term in objective function, inappropriate weigh parameters may block collision avoidance behavior. To cope with this mission, this paper proposes a new DWA variant called Collision Avoidance Dynamic Window Approach (CADWA). It is divided into collision risk detection part and collision avoidance part. Contributions of CADWA include: i) Neighbor set describes neighboring agents and its derivatives detect potential collision; ii) The objective function only focuses on reducing collision risk, so no local minimum will appear; iii) Besides preserving DWA merits like easiness to understand and fast reaction, CADWA does not need parameter tuning; iv) It is convenient to integrate CADWA into formation control algorithm which does not consider collision between agents. Details of CADWA algorithm are described. Simulation results show that two agents finish formation switching without collision.

The advent of these new technologies should provide to biologists, answers more accurate and more comprehensive. However, even if there are several work that revolve around regrouping and providing biological data for the biologists, there are still some issues to be studied; one of them is the integration of this biological information in databases and knowledge bases, in order to provide to biologists important knowledge allowing the characterization of the different causes of diseases. In this paper, we propose a modeling of a multi-agent system for the protein synthesis. Such a system will aim to synthesize, in an automatic way the proteins by exploiting the existing DNA sources, taking into account the dynamic behavior and the interactions that characterize the protein synthesis process. These proteins will be integrated automatically in a database, which will be enriched continuously as long as the sources of DNA exist. Such a database will be used by the biologists for several studies (medical, pharmaceutical, pathological, etc.).

Cloud computing is a business oriented model with efficient infrastructural usage as the prime focus while the multi agent system research is oriented towards the development of intelligent applications on distributed infrastructure. The commonality between the two appears when agents in a multi-agent system trade services with other agents. In recent years, model driven engineering is changing the way software is developed for complex distributed systems. Multi-view models are collection of models for a system under study, where every model is called a ‚Äòview‚Äô of the system and captures a different aspect of the design. Relationships are important aspects of multi-agent system design as agents are evolved from the concept of objects in object oriented modelling. The current work proposes a model for relationship based modelling of service oriented trade in a multi agent system. The proposed model may also be used to model intelligent cloud computing services based on multi-agent systems. The model is one of the 5 ‚Äòviews‚Äô of a 5-View Hyperactive Transaction Meta-Model HTM5 and thus called HTM5-Trade Model.

Information and data exchange in heterogeneous data environment of the diverse market players are difficult due different data model and organization. This paper presents a bottom-up modeling approach of information exchange system for Nigerian deregulated electric power market using Multi-Agents System (MAS). To construct the MAS system, the functionalities of the agents, the interactions among the agents, and agent architecture are designed. A MAS for data communication based on the proposed architecture is an effective way of integrating heterogeneous data sources from the diverse players in the electricity market in Nigeria. MAS is well suitable for considering different scenarios of information exchange among market players as well as testing different requirements of information exchange in the electricity market.

Firstly, a rotating consensus definition is given in the real fields. To solve such a consensus problem, a distributed neighbors'; state feedback-based protocol is introduced. Then by employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, a sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for networks with time-delay is derived to make all agents asymptotically reach rotating consensus while satisfying the desired H‚àû performance. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the containment of the first-order multi-agent system and a kind of control protocol was proposed for the second-order discrete-time systems with fixed time-delay. Finally, computer simulations show the effectiveness of the conclusion.

4|7545168|Conference Paper|2016|Jyh-Cherng Gu|Application of Multi-agent Systems to Microgrid Fault Protection Coordination|In conventional power systems, client-server architecture and centralized control are adopted for data acquisition and supervisory control, and the speed of message transmission and the fault responses is slow. In contrast, various types of distributed energy resources (DERs) with different characteristics and of different capacities exist in a microgrid system, and client-server architecture and centralized control are inadequate for control and operation purpose. In this study, an example microgrid system with a multi-agent system which complies with FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) standard is proposed and built using MATLAB/Simulink and Java Agent Development Framework (JADE). The operations of and among the intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), circuit breakers (CBs), calculation agent and CB agents in the example microgrid system for fault protection coordination under both normal and short-circuit fault conditions are analyzed and discussed. The results demonstrate that protection coordination can be correctly planned and control actions can be executed properly by the multi-agent system in the microgrid system, and the multi-agent system can isolate the fault area and protect the microgrid system in real time under varies conditions.
4|6901414|Conference Paper|2014|Kennedy Ehimwenma|Pre-assessment and Learning Recommendation Mechanism for a Multi-agent System|Diagnostic assessment is a vital and effective strategy in any teaching-learning process such that it provides a pre-learning assessment of the learners state of knowing with regard to a given knowledge concept. Current intelligent learning systems still do not integrate effective techniques for evaluating prior knowledge that can be used effectively to diagnose gaps that will inhibit future learning and for making recommendations for learning and tutoring to fill them. In this paper, we present a mechanism for pre-assessment of previous learning upon which the recommendation for a new or appropriate learning level is based. Our approach is based on message passing procedure between agents in a multi-agent system. We have tested the pre-assessment technique with a prototype based on the Jason Agent Speak language, and using learning materials from a structured query language (SQL) revision module.

Finally, a numerical example is provided based on a multi-agent systems with five agents.
4|8821175|Conference Paper|2018|Neha Bhateja|Study of Ant Colony Optimization Technique for Coalition Formation in Multi Agent Systems|The field of artificial intelligence has given rise to the concept of multi agent systems. An agent in computer science terms is a computer program which acts on behalf of a user or another program to accomplish a predefined task. Coalition formations amongst agents represent a kind of grouping in which they cooperate with each other to effectively achieve their own goal or a common goal. Based on the final goal achievement, agents can be grouped into two categories. First are Individual, autonomous agents which focuses on fulfilling their own goal and are hence termed as selfish agents. The other kind of agents is cooperative agents which put the entire system goal before their own goal. The later kind of agents forms the core part of this paper. Agents in a multi agent system may need to cooperate in order to complete the tasks. We form a group of agents from the set of agents in cases where a single agent may not complete the given task or if it complete, the performance is not optimal from the systems point of view. This paper presents the ant colony optimization technique to coalition formation problem in MAS.

With the introduction of mirror operation, two global distributed nonlinear consensus protocols are constructed for each first-order agent under strongly connected information flow. The distinctive feature of this paper is to address the explicit bounds of the finite settling time for both protocols are independent of initial condition, which makes it possible for network consensus problems of a multi-agent team with guaranteed convergence time. Further, the second protocol is valid for the networks of multi-agents with switching topology provided that the sum of time intervals, in which the information flow is strongly connected, is larger than the estimated upper-bound for settling time. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our theoretical results.
5|8243357|Conference Paper|2017|Fangfang Zhang|The distributed optimal consensus algorithms for general linear multi-agent systems|In this paper, the distributed optimal consensus algorithms for general linear multi-agent systems are considered. The dynamics for the N agents are independent and homogeneous. The quadratic cost consists of three terms, one corresponds to the importance of approaching the destination (consensus value), the second term corresponds to the importance of formation maintenance, and the third term is the total expended energy. Under the following three conditions, the graph is connected, the subsystem is controllable, and the weighted matrices of the cost function satisfy that one Riccati equation and one Lyapunov equation have the same positive definite solution, we can get the distributed optimal controller and the system can be consensusable. The solutions of this paper consist of some existing results as the special cases.
5|6561725|Conference Paper|2013|Xu Zhang|Event-triggered consensus for second-order leaderless multi-agent systems|Future multi-agent systems will be equipped with embedded microprocessors with limited resources to gather information and update the control law of each agent. It has been shown that the event-triggered strategy is an effective way for designing control protocol of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of a second-order leaderless multi-agent systems where the control strategy is event-triggered. The controller of each agent updates when a certain function is triggered, which depends on the ratio of a defined measurement error with respect to the norm of a disagreement vector. For multi-agent systems with a connected topology, we give sufficient conditions to solve the event-triggered consensus problem in a centralised way. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to validate the proposed strategy.

Bendjeghaba|Multi-agent ant system for redundancy allocation problem of multi states power system|This paper considers a redundancy allocation problem for a multi-state power system. This type of problems involves selection of components with multiple choices and redundancy levels that produce maximum benefits, subject to the system availability and demand constraints. The presented multi agent ant system finds the optimal system topology by choosing system elements from a list of available equipments. Each element is characterized by its productivity, availability and cost. The objective is to minimize the total investment costs while satisfying both system availability and demand constraints. The procedure based on the generalized Ushakovpsilas technique is used for evaluation of the system availability. Illustrative examples demonstrate how to obtain the optimal structures of the power system for different system availability constraints.

In this context, we are interested in personalized systems and particularly in Personalized Multi-Agent Systems (PMAS) characterized by collective and intelligent resolution in a distributed and parallel environment. This work assesses personalization, the most important characteristic of interface in multi-agent systems. As a few studies dealt with the personalization assessment in a multi-agent system, we try, in this work, to address this issue by focusing on web scraping and crawling social networks.

5|8122916|Conference Paper|2017|Kao-Shing Hwang|A shaped-q learning for multi-agents systems|This paper proposes an architecture where each agent maintains a cooperative tendency table (CTT). In the process of learning, agents need not communicate with each other but observe partners'; actions while taking actions. If one of the agents meets a bad situation, such as bumping onto obstacles after taking an action. In such a case, agents will receive a bad reward from the environment. Similarly, if one agent reaches a goal after taking an action, agents obtain a good reward instead. Rewards are used to update the policy and to adjust cooperative tendency values which are recorded in the individual CTT. When an agent perceives a state, the corresponding cooperative tendency value, and the Q-value are merged to a Shaped-Q value. The action with maximal Shaped-Q value in this state will be selected. After agents take actions and receive a reward, agents update their own CTTs. Therefore, agents could use this method to reach a consensus more quickly to enhance learning efficiency and reduce the occurrence of stagnation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can speed up the learning process and solve the problem of huge memory space consumption to some degrees. As well, it can make agents complete the task together more efficiently.
5|9280796|Conference Paper|2020|Sergey Listopad|Solving the Regional Power Grid Restoration Problem with the Prototype of the Hybrid Intelligent Multi-Agent System of Heterogeneous Thinking|The practical problem solving process in dynamic environments, besides, is characterized by a lack of time for decision-making, the interdependence of the performed actions and the complexity of correcting erroneous decisions. The traditionally applied collective problem solving in such conditions is ineffective, because by the time the agreed decision is made it becomes irrelevant. In this regard, it is necessary to develop informational intelligent systems capable of relevantly simulating the collective reasoning of experts and offering recommendations to the user of the systems, reducing the time of his reaction to events occurring in the control object. For these purposes, hybrid intelligent multi-agent systems of heterogeneous thinking have been proposed. In this paper, the use of the laboratory prototype of such a system to solve one of the problems with dynamic environment is considered, namely regional power grid restoration planning after large-scale emergencies.

A residual generator is designed by using a geometric approach. By defining the unobservablility subspace of the LPV multi-agent system, we design a set of residual generators which are sensitive to some actuator fault and decoupled from noise and other faults. Due to the fact that such residual generators only depend on the direction of the faults and noises and have nothing to do with the amplitudes of faults and noises, this method can be used to detect incipient faults, small faults and intermittent faults even with large noises. We bring forward a detailed algorithm to calculate the desired parameters. Finally, a simulation results on small satellites are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed distributed FDI algorithm.

Kuzin|An Approach of the JADE and Simulink Interaction to Control Smart Grid Based on the Multi Agent System|Generation, distribution, consumption - these are the topics of last ten years. This work deals with the smart grid operation, especially for intelligent distribution of energy in power systems. Because of the nonlinear characteristic of the daily energy consumption, grid has to be controlled on time with sufficient accuracy and has to be well predicted. There are some of up-to-date techniques to do that: predictive control, fuzzy logic, neural networks etc. But to link every transducer, device, load, generator in the grid one needs to have an approach that will suit to each of them. Agent is intelligent entity that refers to any kind of device in the electric grid that interacts with the electric energy. The paper demonstrates the efficiency of the implementation of Multi-Agent System (MAS) in smart grid to control its operation. The operation of MAS system is developed using JADE (Java Agent Development Environment) framework.

The key issues that arise in this pursuit are how to cope with new and changing information and how to manage the steadily increasing amount of available data. This paper describes a novel agent architecture that has been developed and tested to address these issues by combining innovative approaches from three distinct research areas: software agents, geo referenced data modeling, and content-based image retrieval (CBIR). The overall system architecture is based on a multi-agent paradigm where agents autonomously search for images over the Internet, then convert the images to a vector used for use in searching and retrieval. Results show that this system is capable of significantly reducing the time and management effort associated with large amounts of image data.

In the systems, each agent can be controlled by controlling its position and velocity. To reach the consensus of the systems, the feedback gain is designed in the control input of the consensus protocol. The control input of each agent is influenced by its position and velocity. There is a directed spanning tree in the corresponding communication topology. This condition is general and weak. Some sufficient conditions are obtained to solve the consensus problem.

5|4407315|Conference Paper|2007|Enrique Gonz√°lez|MRCC: A Multi-Resolution Cooperative Control Agent Architecture|The cooperation problem in a complex robotic environment requires the use of explicit mechanisms and control architectures specifically designed to manage the cooperation. Powerful ways of structuring cooperation complexity are required, including models, methodologies, software architectures, information systems and frameworks. In this paper the intentional cooperation control model MRCC, multi-resolution cooperation control is presented; in particular, the internal agent architecture is studied in detail. The model takes advantage of the multi agent systems (MAS) benefits in order to provide an integral and flexible architecture. The main idea of the MRCC model is based on a hierarchical decomposition of the MAS cooperative control, where each layer manages the decisions at different granularity and abstraction levels. Higher levels take into account general aspects of the system control and generate influences over lower ones. Lower levels manage negotiation mechanism to achieve cooperative actions and control of individual agents. The internal agent architecture is built using a concurrent approach, where several behaviors interact to integrate in a coherent way the operation and contribution of the different MRCC levels. The preliminary simulation results demonstrate that the model can be applied in different multi robot tasks.

The concept of autonomous agents fits most actors in road transportation network, i.e., the weather, the traffic, the driver. Moreover, the traffic signals and the weather condition can also be regarded as an autonomous agent. Though, there is increasing number of agents, typical agents respond to changes in their environment inspite of highly couple. Most challenges for standard techniques are created by this domain in road transportation network from multi-agent systems such as road traffic control, weather and transport planning. This paper, first, proposes a new approach, and then, addresses the challenges for future works using multi-agent systems.

6|858483|Conference Paper|2000|P. Davidsson|A multi-agent system for controlling intelligent buildings|Gives a high-level description of a project aimed at investigating the usefulness of the agent metaphor and the notion of multi-agent systems for the design of control systems for intelligent buildings. The use of the agent approach was initially motivated by the close mapping that it offered between the entities of the application domain and the entities of the software. The concurrent non-deterministic nature of the activities inside the building was another factor that led to the development of concurrent autonomous entities. We argue that the suggested multi-agent system architecture can be easily adapted to almost any building. Also, the implementation of the system allows for dynamic re-configuration of the agents, without disrupting the operation of the system. Finally, simulation results indicate that the approach is viable and that considerable energy savings are possible, while at the same time providing added value for the customer. Also, the approach enables a much more fine-grained control of the tradeoff between energy saving and customer satisfaction than current approaches do.

This new control protocol is featured by introducing an internal dynamic variable, which is the engine of the of dynamic event triggering algorithm. The triggering conditions of the agents are not only affected by the current states and the state measurement error of the agents but also those previous ones. And the triggering condition is more maneuverability. A Lyapunov function is used to prove the consensus of the multi-agent system under the dynamic event-triggered control. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed protocol is illustrated by simulations.
6|1587844|Conference Paper|2005|Quan Bai|A colored Petri net based strategy for multi-agent scheduling|In the last decade, the focus of agent research has shifted from single agent systems to multi-agent systems (MASs). Dynamic agent coordination is one of the challenge problems of multi-agent research. One coordination problem is how to achieve agent scheduling under open dynamic environments. Petri nets (PNs) and colored Petri nets (CPNs) are system study tools that provide an appropriate mathematical formalism for the description, construction and analysis of distributed and concurrent systems. In this paper, we present a CPN based strategy to schedule and allocate new tasks to suitable agent(s) or agent combinations. In this strategy, through using CPNs to represent the dynamic statuses of agents, agent coordinators are able to check concurrent agent statuses and make correct and optimal decisions.
6|6699087|Conference Paper|2013|D. B. Megherbi|A study of collaborative distributed multi-goal &amp; multi-agent-based systems for large Critical Key Infrastructures and Resources (CKIR) dynamic monitoring and surveillance|In many homeland security and counterterrorism applications, there is a need to secure and protect large Critical Key Infrastructures and Resources (CKIR), such as transportation, aviation, highways, and maritime systems. These usually span hundreds of thousands to millions of miles of roadways, maritime, and/or airways. To achieve the monitoring of such large CKIR systems there is a need to develop cooperative intelligent geographically and computationally distributed multi-agent-based monitoring systems. In such dynamic large environments, where agents could be moving randomly or less randomly to reach their respective goals, agent path planning for autonomous agents becomes challenging. It is desired to have the agents not only be equipped with intelligence to move autonomously and avoid obstacles and each other, but also to be able to learn autonomously how to reach the shortest path to their goal(s) in a minimum amount of time and exploratory trials. In this paper we address issues related to multi-agent reinforcement learning in a distributed-computing-memory environment where the agents have limited and not complete knowledge of their environment(s). We present an architecture for the distributed dynamic agent communication based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). In particular, the focus and contribution of this paper are two-fold: the analysis of the effects, on the multi-agent system learning and total execution time, of (a) the agent environment size, (b) the agents shared-over-a-network learned information with/from other agents with one same goal versus agents not sharing information among themselves and (c) the agents sharing information when having one same agent goal versus the agents sharing information when having different agent goals. The desired aim is the analysis of the factors and conditions that increase the overall distributed multi-agent system computational performance and learning speed.

A case study has been done to demonstrate the functionality in Matlab-Simulink environment. The multi-agent system is implemented by using an open source agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Finally, both micro grid simulation and multi-agent system are connected together via MACSimJX toolbox. The simulation results indicate that proposed multi-agent system may facilitate the seamless transition from grid connected to an island mode when upstream outages are detected. This reveals the intelligence of multi-agent system for controlling the micro grid operation.

By utilizing specified-time optimal control approaches, a class of novel containment tracking algorithms are proposed. In order to solve the containment control problem in a settling time specified in advance, a sampling time sequence, which converges to the specified time, is designed. During each time interval of the sampling time sequence, the proposed algorithm is used for single-integrator multi-agent systems. Thus, the proposed algorithm is a sampling-data-based specified-time containment tracking algorithm. Due to the settling time can be specified in advance, this algorithm is very meaningful and consistent with practical requirements. Finally, we propose a numerical simulation to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

In order to obtain control law in multi-agent systems, usually agents'; information should be exactly known, which may not be available in real applications. In this work, a method is proposed to estimate the position and velocity of agents with arbitrary initial conditions of followers and leaders. Then, the estimations are used to obtain a consensus control law. At first, a single integrator nonlinear multi-agent system with a leader is considered, and a consensus law is proposed using followers'; position estimations. Then, for a double integrator nonlinear system, a controller is obtained based on position and velocity estimations. Several simulations are performed to validate the proposed method.

Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
6|6524455|Conference Paper|2013|Vineet Nagrath|Introducing the Concept of Hyperactivity in Multi Agent Systems|Software Agents are no longer the simple communication gateways for devices to interconnect using one or more networks. With Multi Agent Systems contributing in a wide spectrum of intelligent systems, the Agents are in a more proactive role than just being responsible for passing messages between their respective base systems. Agent Relation Charts and the Hyperactive Transaction Model in general is one of the recent attempts of developing a multi-view design model for Multi Agent Systems. The model has made a clear distinction in the regular and intelligent activities of an agent. Based on these differences, the agents are classified into three main categories named as Passive, Active and Hyperactive Agents. In this paper we first attempt to clearly explain the basis on which distinctions are made in the activities of an agent, and why such a distinction improves the overall design process for the multi agent systems. We then define and demonstrate the three kinds of agents based on the distinctions made in their activities and thus introducing the concept of Hyperactivity in a multi agent system.
6|4740599|Conference Paper|2008|Yoann Kubera|Interaction Selection Ambiguities in Multi-agent Systems|To ensure multi-agent based simulation models reproducibility, particular attention must be payed on its possible implementation ambiguities. This concerns every aspect of simulation';s architecture, including how the agent selects the actions it performs, and on which agents it is performed. On this point, classical agent-centered design methodologies leave room to implicit design choices. We show in this paper how an interaction-centered design methodology provides guidelines to elicit these choices, and to remove possible implementation ambiguities underlying agent design. To illustrate this issue, we study which ambiguities underly even simple models and how our interaction-based methodology makes them appear.

6|6911515|Conference Paper|2014|Haiwei Liu|H[infinity] Consensus of Multi-agent Systems with Random Time-Delay|This paper investigates the problem of H‚àû synchronizations of multi-agent system with random time-delay. It is assumed that the topology of the system is fixed directed and connected. Considering that there are random communication time delays between the agents and additive perturbations, a consensus protocol is forwarded based on the consistence control algorithm. The delay is based on a given probability and the perturbations are assumed to be stable and bounded in H‚àû-norm by some priori given desired tolerance. By using Lyapunov analysis and stochastic techniques, the sufficient condition expressed in the form of LMI(Linear Matrix Inequality) is derived under which the system achieves its synchronization. All the agents finally synchronize to a dynamic reference state. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the validity of the result.
6|1612154|Conference Paper|2005|R.F. Maia|Work in Progress - A Distributed Approach to a Learning Management System using Multi-Agent Technology|The agent technology has in the autonomy of a single agent one of its most important features. The collaboration between agents, inference and learning capabilities are other interesting features. All these issues seem to be useful to represent students in an electronic system, because they permit the creation of virtual tutors that could follow the steps and the evolution of the students. It is a way to improve the interaction between students, teachers and professors. The agent technology could also be applied to create distributed Learning Management Systems (LMS). With some artificial intelligence methods it would be possible to build a distributed Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). This paper presents two possible architectures of distributed LMS: one using a LMS to store the knowledge (such as a domain module of a ITS) and agents representing the tutor and student modules of an ITS. In the second approach, there is no LMS and all ITS functions are distributed between agents. This paper discusses the benefits of these approaches and how agents can provide help for the students in these architectures

With a dynamic reconfigurable SCM system, new products and processes can be introduced with considerably less expense and ramp-up time.
6|6814429|Conference Paper|2014|Xinhe Chen|Study of multi-agent based distributed control for distribution system with integration of distributed generations|In this paper, a distributed control method for distribution system with integration of distributed generations is proposed based on multi-agent system technology. Considering the requirement of voltage control and power factor correction, the distribution system voltage/var control model is built under the multi-agent system framework. To realize distributed control, the voltage adjustment message is suggested to be forwarded to upstream bus agents while the reactive power adjustment message forwarded to downstream bus agents. A width-first communication mechanism is proposed for a bus agent to seek for assistance from the other bus agents. And the coordination control strategy and further the control process are designed for distributed control coordination. The proposed voltage/var control method relies only on the local sensing information and the exchanged information from the neighboring bus agents. Voltage control case and power factor correction case are both executed by a distribution system example. The case studies results show that the proposed method is effective in improving the voltage profile of the system and facilitating the development of the distributed generation.

6|8945496|Journal Article|2020|Zhitao Li|Distributed adaptive cooperative tracking of uncertain nonlinear fractional-order multi-agent systems|In this paper, the leader-following tracking problem of fractional-order multi-agent systems is addressed. The dynamics of each agent may be heterogeneous and has unknown nonlinearities. By assumptions that the interaction topology is undirected and connected and the unknown nonlinear uncertain dynamics can be parameterized by a neural network, an adaptive learning law is proposed to deal with unknown nonlinear dynamics, based on which a kind of cooperative tracking protocols are constructed. The feedback gain matrix is obtained to solve an algebraic Riccati equation. To construct the fully distributed cooperative tracking protocols, the adaptive law is also adopted to adjust the coupling weight. With the developed control laws, we can prove that all signals in the closed-loop systems are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a simple simulation example is provided to illustrate the established result.

In order to overcome this problem, we investigate the convergence speed adjustment problem of first order leader-following multi-agent systems. Firstly, we propose a Œ≥-adaptive consensus protocol, where the weights of the edges can adaptively change according to the state difference between neighbouring agents. Then, a sufficient condition for consensus is given and the convergence speed is proved can be quantitatively adjusted through changing the value of Œ≥ approximately. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate theoretical results.

A recent research has produced SRL process mapping but the research was limited to producing a simulation video from historical data to prove the occurrence of SRL processes in online learning management system. This paper proposes to extend that research by adopting the concept of personal knowledge management (PKM) using the GUSC Model, to design an agent-based SRL simulation. This would enable real-time data to be analysed as and when it is needed for prediction of SRL activities. The design of the multi-agent system is possible with the availability of data and knowledge on how these data could be interpreted by the software agents to present an SRL process in both graphical and text report forms. This paper presents the process of analysing students'; online SRL behaviour throughout a semester, taking into account a technical course as the benchmark case study, and designing the agent- based simulation for lecturers'; prediction on students'; online SRL behaviour. In order to do so, simulation video from the recent work is analysed to capture moment-to-moment SRL processes. The purpose of this analysis is mainly to facilitate the understanding of how software agents could be animated step by step. The results from this study is expected to be beneficial to the stakeholders of online education system. Future work will be on developing the agent-based simulation of SRL.

7|4402303|Conference Paper|2007|Qiuli Yu|Multi-Agent Based Reconfiguration of an Electric Propulsion System for All Electric-Ships|Although its high efficiency, fast response, and increasing reliability, current protection schemes for shipboard power systems do not consider vital load satisfaction and power balance problems that occur with fault isolation and reconfiguration. A reconfiguration system is needed to solve power balance problems and try to satisfy vital loads as much as possible. Current reconfiguration techniques include mathematic programming, meta-heuristics, and knowledge-based programming. All of which are centralized methods and cannot meet the Navy';s needs for fight-through survivability and high reliability. This paper presents a multi-agent system (MAS) to reconfigure the ship electric propulsion system, which is an important part of ship power systems. The MAS has no global control and agents have to collaborate with each other to achieve the reconfiguration objective. Due to its decentralized feature, the MAS-based reconfiguration is preferable over centralized reconfiguration methods and can increase fight-through survivability and reliability.

7|6775753|Conference Paper|2013|Lei Ding|Sampled-data leader-following consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems with communication delay|This paper is concerned with sampled-data leader-following consensus for nonlinear multi-agent systems with communication delay. Considering the effect of communication delay, a new sampled-data consensus control protocol with variable sampling period is proposed. With this protocol, the leader-following consensus of the multi-agent system is equivalently converted to the stability of a class of system with a time-varying delay. Then, by employing Lyapunov-Krosovskii functional method, a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived, which ensures that the leader-following consensus of the multiagent system can be asymptotically achieved. Moreover, based on this criterion, the consensus controller gain is obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the design method.

7|6896857|Conference Paper|2014|Jianzhen Li|Cooperative tracking for multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics via continuous controllers|This paper deals with the cooperative tracking problem for multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics. A novel estimator-based tracking algorithm is proposed, together with a sufficient condition for the followers to track the dynamic leader. In this algorithm, an estimator is designed to estimate the unknown control input of the leader. Different from most of the existing algorithms on coordinated tracking problems for multi-agent systems, where discontinuous controllers are used, the control input in this algorithm is continuous. Theoretical analysis shows that the followers can track the leader with ultimately bounded tracking errors, if parameters in the cooperative tracking algorithm are properly chosen. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

A new class of distributed observer-type containment protocols based only on the relative output measurements of the neighboring agents is proposed, removing the impractical assumption in some of the existing approaches that the observers embedded in the multiple dynamic agents have to share information with their neighbors. Under the mild assumption that, for each follower, there exists at least one leader having a directed path to that follower, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the states of the followers to asymptotically converge to a convex hull formed by those of the dynamic leaders. Finally, some numerical simulations on containment of a multi-vehicle system are given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Firstly, the layered model of the bidding decision support system for power supplier has been proposed. In this model, the system composes of four layers: data gathering layer, data processing layer, bidding analyzing layer and bidding decision-making layer. Additionally, in order to realize the human-computer interaction, the presentation layer has been added in the system. In the presentation layer, in order to integrate the useful web data to data warehouse, the method is proposed to transfer the HTML page into XML data source combined with Agent technology. So, the power supplier could make the best of network resource, and transfer them into own data warehouse for building the optimal bidding strategy. Then, the applications of Agent on the application layer and on the data layer are analyzed respectively. In the implementation of the functional Agent, it is the blackboard system that has been used to design communication mode, the Agent is constructed by the deliberative Agent structure, and by KQML language, the communication principle and communication language among the function modules has been realized. According to this method, the feasible and efficient bidding decision support system could be constituted for the power supplier. Finally an example of application has been given to illustrate that it is valuable for the power supplier to constitute the bidding decision-making support system based on multi-Agent for optimal bidding strategy.
8|1323039|Magazine Article|2004|Z. Guessoum|Adaptive agents and multiagent systems|New information systems and recent applications (grid computing, Web Services, and so on) are often distributed, large-scale, open, heterogeneous, and characterized by a dynamic environment. To model these complex systems, researchers have spent much effort during the last few years on multiagent systems. The aim is to model complex distributed systems as a set of (possibly organized) software agents that interact in a common environment. The decomposition of a system into a number of agents lets the system react and adapt better in a changing environment. Moreover, organized structures (&#034;social&#034; structures) can emerge from interactions between agents, which in turn constrain and coordinate the agents'; behavior. A multiagent system takes its metaphors of interaction from social systems rather than using the metaphor of the isolated thinker that early artificial intelligence researchers preferred. An important issue when dealing with this increasing complexity is to build adaptive agents and multiagent systems. Agents and multiagent systems must be aware of their own capabilities and of changes to other agents and their environment. To remain effective, agents must be able to adapt their structures and knowledge while they execute.

 distributed formation and tracking control for high-order multi-agent systems is investigated in this paper. Assuming that the multi-agent network is directed, considering the extern distance, the distributed formation and tracking control protocols are both designed for the cases of no delay and constant time delay. By transformation, the formation and tracking problems are transformed into the stability problem of error systems. Then by using Lyapunov theory, the sufficient conditions of error system';s stability are presented in the form of LMIs. Finally, the simulation results prove the effectiveness of designed protocols.

Taking the constrains of communication bandwidth and storage space into consideration, a logarithmic quantizer is introduced for each channel. To further save communications costs, an event-triggered broadcasting scheme is developed for each channel, without incurring Zeno behavior. Based on the above communication protocol, to achieve consensus, a distributed event-triggered quantized consensus controller is developed for each agent. Compared with the consensus control methods that rely on continuous communication, the proposed method saves the communication costs in both temporal and spatial aspects. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated by the results of simulation.

Through the performance comparison, it is verified that the proposed scheme fairly distributes the energy consumption over the agents, and maximizes the lifetime of the MAS for a given time constraint in the system.

For a better land cover classification, it is necessary to bring in more spatial information as auxiliary. While more spatial information may also lead to the over-fitting of the classifier algorithm, which, especially under the circumstance of few samples, will in return devalues classification quality. Select useful features are very important for remote sensing classification. The traditional rough set based feature selection algorithms utilize greedy search method which unstable and relay on initial feature input sequence.

In fact, one child dies from heatstroke nearly every 10 days from being left in a hot vehicle. For this reason, this work focuses on using current technology to help prevent such fatalities. We have used intelligent agents, which have proved to be rather efficient since they can monitor, coordinate events and disseminate information as well as communicate with each other. We have developed a multi-agent architecture that detects when young children left in child safety seats inside vehicles are at high risk of heatstroke and sends an alert message to the driver';s smartphone. The design of the architecture using the INGENIAS methodology is described.

9|8000098|Conference Paper|2017|J.A. Dom√≠nguez-Navarro|Local electrical market based on a Multi-agent system|The rise of distributed generation makes more difficult the power balance between demand and generation in electrical networks, especially by the uncertainty of renewable generation. Smart grid concepts have been developed to solve this problem. A set of generators, loads and storage devices are locally managed to minimize the energy cost. These smart grids have surpluses and deficits of energy along time, so they have to interact in a local smart market. In this paper, we present a local smart market based on a multi-agent system. Every smart grid has a manager agent that minimizes its energy cost (intra-market). Then, it offers the surplus of energy or requests the deficit of energy to other neighbour smart grids. An auction allows fixing the energy and economical interchange among smart grids (inter-market). The manager agent can buy energy in the auction when it is cheaper than the energy of their own generators even if these generators have surplus of energy. A Multi-agent system has been developed in JADE platform.

The protocol design takes fully into account the state quantization feedback of the neighbor agents in transmission over a limited-communication channel. A fixed quantization level is firstly considered, at this stage, by constructing distributed input quantized protocol and designing two nested invariant regions, all states of the multi-agent system starting in the bigger region approach the smaller one. To guarantee further convergence, then the dynamic state quantization is considered. By dynamically adjusting quantization levels of the quantizer in real time, the sizes of the nested invariant regions gradually become smaller. In this case, a hybrid quantized control scheme is developed. It turned out that for a connected network, the multi-agent system achieves the quantized consensus asymptotically under the constructed controllers.

9|8901051|Conference Paper|2019|Shauharda Khadka|Memory-Based Multiagent One-Shot Learning: Extended Abstract|Learning correct behavior from one example (one-shot learning) is particularly difficult in multiagent systems where the pertinent information is potentially distributed across agents, and the emergent behavior of the system is dependent on inter-agent interactions. This paper introduces Distributed Modular Memory Units (DMMU), a distributed multiagent learning framework. DMMU uses a shared external memory to enable one-shot adaptive learning in multiagent systems. The external memory is accessed by agents acting independently and in parallel. Agents operate by processing their individual states and deciding when to interact with the shared external memory unit. This allows agents to identify, retain, and propagate information among the team. Subsequently, DMMU can rapidly assimilate task features from a group of distributed agents and successfully use the information to accomplish distributed one-shot learning. We compare the performance of the DMMU framework on a simulated cybersecurity task with traditional feed-forward ensembles, long short-term memory based agents, and a centralized learner. Results demonstrate that DMMU shows at least 100% performance improvement over the other methods, and exhibits distributed one-shot learning to effectively solve this complex task.

9|9358436|Conference Paper|2021|HoSub Lee|Optimal Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems with Input Constraints: A State Decomposition Approach|This paper presents optimal consensus control for multi-agent systems with input constraints by using a state decomposition approach. The state decomposition approach is to divide the state space into consensus subspace and its orthonormal complement subspace. The proposed equality condition ensures that consensus subspace is consensus. Therefore, if we design the gain K that orthonormal subspace converges to zero, the consensus is achieved. Solving the proposed optimization problem that minimizes global cost function guarantees consensus control with input constraints of states. To solve the optimization problem, linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation is used. The simulation results of numerical examples show that the proposed condition achieves multi-agent systems consensus.

In our scheme, all agents finally converge to a circle around the target and then move along it. Firstly, a distributed protocol is given for each agent to estimate the position of static target. It is shown that the estimation of each agent eventually converges to the target as the information topology contains a jointly spanning tree by employing the properties of row-stochastic matrix and non-negative matrix. Secondly, another distributed protocol is given for each agent moves around the target in a given circle. More important, all agents reach consensus on angular velocity and move uniformly distributed in this circle. Finally, a numerical example is introduced. The results of simulation illustrate the validity of the proposed method.

9|7030505|Conference Paper|2014|Yanumula Venkata Karteek|Consensus in multi-agent systems with switching topologies using position based back-stepping|This paper focuses on the consensus problem in a decentralized multi-agent system with switching communication topologies. Consensus of agents can be reached for centralized dynamically switching topologies when the union of all topologies forms a spanning tree graph. In case of decentralized control, the topology must form a strongly connected graph to reach consensus. A new algorithm, which uses ‚Äúback-stepping‚Äù of agents, is proposed in this work which assures consensus whenever the topology is not strongly connected. The algorithm ensures that when an agent reaches a position where if loses communication with others and the topology is no more a strongly connected graph, it back-tracks and take a different path to reach consensus. Simulation results show that after introducing back-stepping, each of the agent';s path is chosen to ensure that communication with other agents is maintained and they come to a consensus in minimum possible time.

Although wireless channels provide a more suitable application environment than the wired channels, the studies on the problems that may arise when MAS is implemented on wireless channels are limited in the literature. Wireless channel applications of MAS are more vulnerable to security problems or errors arising from the characteristics of the channels. This study aims to investigate the effect of jammers that can be encountered in wireless communication networks using Monte Carlo simulations under various performance criteria.

9|8540550|Conference Paper|2018|Khudhair Abbas Mohammed|Security Enhancement During Agents Communication in GNA Approach|In many dynamic environments, where humans and agents coexist, agents cooperate for internal and external resources to achieve their goals. Consequently, the agents are exposed to the risk of being attacked by malicious agents. Such situation, if not mitigated, risks the entire model and threatens its long-term performances. Due to uncertainties of an agent and its potential behavior, especially in human-agent collaboration systems, an agent might behave fraudulently to its partners (humans or agents). Therefore, security is a crucial aspect in the initial development of a collaborative human-agent system. However, many research envisages the security aspects only in the implementation stage. At this stage, a security model is strictly formulated based on the techniques and constraints among agents. Over the past decade, many researchers propose various security models with outstanding features. However, despite the features of the proposed security models, there is still a lack of research effort in security aspects for multi-agent systems, which is considered as a critical challenge. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the Generic Nodal Abstraction (GNA) approach with a security model applied among agents in their communication. The enhancements include authentication, message encryption and interaction constraints.

The vast amount of data and the complex processes behind on-line fault detection indicate the need for an automated solution. The classification of partial discharge signatures from gas insulated substations, as a result of applying different artificial intelligence techniques within a multi agent system, is described in this paper. A multi agent system that views the problem as an interaction of simple independent software entities, for effective use of the available data, is presented. The overall solution is derived from the combination of solutions provided by the components of the multi-agent system. This multi-agent system can employ various intelligent system techniques and has been implemented using the ZEUS Agent Building Toolkit.

It is becoming more and more popular around the globe. Escalation in the use of lightweight devices and PDA';s leads us to create a solid base for future nomadic applications, positioned in a changing environment. Intelligent agents are the program that carry out tasks on behalf of the user and apply some degree of intelligence to the tasks by interacting with other agents. The intelligence may be pretty minimal but often will include some degree of learning from past experience. SAGE-LITE is a lightweight context aware multi-agent system which senses the capabilities of the lightweight devices and reacts accordingly. It enhances the capabilities of an existing system - SAGE - and makes it compatible with a vast variety of currently available lightweight devices through its intelligent agents. When agents supporting nomadic users are developed, optimization of agent communication for wireless environment is one of the key issues. This paper addresses the issues of wireless environment and gives the detailed design of context-aware light-weight multi-agent system. The system has the ability to sense the capabilities of the devices in the given context and react accordingly. As the system is based on the latest FIPA specifications, agent uses the FIPA-ACL for communication and bit-efficient protocol for encoding and decoding of ACL message
9|9326863|Conference Paper|2020|Yaozhong Wang|Constrained containment control problems for multi-agent system with changing communication topologies|Many of the existing papers about the containment control problem for multi-agent systems were built under an ideal setting and only a few works concerned about the physical constraints of the states and the control inputs of the agents. The idea of this paper is to study the set tracking problems multi-agent system subject to convex-position constraints and switching topologies. The first contribution is to find a condition which ensures each agent to have the possibility to track the given set when all agents are assumed to stay in their own convex-position constraint sets. The second contribution is to propose two nonlinear distributed algorithms to guarantee that all agents will ultimately move into a convex hull spanned by all the leaders and introduce an analysis approach to deal with the set tracking problems when position constraints and changing communication topologies are taken into consideration simultaneously.
9|699284|Conference Paper|1998|C. Preist|An adaptive choice of messaging protocol in multi-agent systems|There are a variety of choices which need to be made when setting up a multi-agent community. In particular, which agents communicate with which, what protocols they use, and what information flows from one to another. Such design choices will affect the efficiency of the community with respect to several parameters accuracy, speed of solution, and message load. In this paper, we consider one class of problem which multi-agent systems engage in-service provision. Using a simple, abstract, form of this problem, we use a mathematical analysis to show that three different messaging protocols result in varying message loads, depending on certain parameters such as number of agents and frequency of request. If the parameters are fixed, we can conclude which of these three protocols is most efficient. However, these parameters will usually vary over time, and hence the best of the three protocols will vary. We show that the community can adopt the best protocol if each individual agent makes a local decision based on which protocol will minimise its own message load. Hence, local decisions lead to globally good behaviour. We demonstrate this both mathematically and experimentally.

The global leader-following consensus can be achieved in finite time over directed and detail-balanced communication topology under the proposed control protocol, which employs a priori saturation in order to deal with the constraints imposed on the control input and simplify the analysis. Utilizing the tools from the algebraic graph theory, Lyapunov theory and homogeneity of system dynamics with dilation, we prove in a universal way that our designed consensus protocol can solve the global finite-time consensus problem. The effectiveness of the theoretical result is illustrated with numerical simulations.

By introducing a distributed event-triggered communication scheme to select the broadcast data and analyzing the effect of network-induced delays on the control input of each agent, the resulting networked multi-agent systems are modeled as an augmented system with multiple interval time-varying delays. A multiple delay bounds dependent consensus condition is obtained by a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Based on the consensus condition of the augmented system, a consensus control protocol is designed such that all follower agents can asymptotically reach the state of the leader. The effectiveness of the proposed results is validated by a numerical example.

Sincerity is one of an ethical behaviour that can be considered for instilling in software agent environment, especially for encouraging the cooperation in completing tasks within an agent community. However, a mechanism to avoid imbalance in workload between software agents should be established to avoid the sincere agent from taking many tasks from its teammates until it cannot timely complete its own task. In our study, we present three evaluators in Workload Manager: (1) permission of getting favour evaluator, (2) workload calculator and (3) the progress of a worker agent';s current task. These evaluators are used to evaluate the capability of an agent before taking any task from its teammate and also to determine the right time for the agent to offer the favour to its teammate. The interaction of the Workload Manager and the agent community is presented to show how it works in sincere software agent environment.

10|5172747|Conference Paper|2008|Ebrahim AlHashel|Extending Prometheus with Agent Cooperation|Agent cooperation is a central component of many multi-agent systems. To be successful in open, multi-agent environments, agents must be capable of dynamically forming a team and solving a problem by cooperating with each other. Such an autonomous agent cooperation process has the potential to execute a plan to achieve a common goal. To date numerous methodologies for agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) have been proposed in the literature. However, those methodologies lack the ability to model agent cooperation strategies effectively. This research work proposes a set of artefacts to extend Prometheus development methodology in order to support agent cooperation. We will illustrate the extended Prometheus methodology using an example from the domain of e-commerce. The results are presented and our future work is discussed.

10|9096018|Conference Paper|2019|Qi Han|Leader-following consensus of multi-agent system based on cellular neural networks framework|Cellular neural networks have been applied in many fields and have shown good results. Therefore, this article studies the leader-following consensus problem (MSALFC) of multi-agent systems with fixed directed topology under cellular neural networks framework (CNNF). Compared with the common consensus problem, agents'; communication topology is reconstructed through CNNF. Then, the breadth-first algorithm is used to cut unnecessary connections in the system. So that the undirected communication topology based on CNNF is transformed into a directed topology with only one spanning tree and communication protocol are constructed. Finally, an effective control protocol is designed to help the system achieve leader-follower consensus and Lyapunov stability theory is used to establish the sufficient condition to guarantee the realization of MSALFC. The communication protocol based on CNNF can not only effectively achieve the consistency of the system, but also reduce the communication traffic in the System. Numerical simulation is given to illustrate the theoretical results.

The optimal gain matrix of the proposed filters is derived and the effectiveness of the filters is shown through simulation.

In addition, through XML-RPC interface for Maglog which we have also implemented, other systems can easily utilize Maglog.

10|5375758|Conference Paper|2009|Fahimeh Farahnakian|Reinforcement Learning for Soccer Multi-agents System|Recently the reinforcement learning method is actively used in multi-agent systems. Because of this method played a significant role by handling the inherent complexity of such systems. Robotic soccer is a multi-agent system in which agents play in real-time, dynamic, complex and unknown environment. Since the main purpose of a soccer game is to score goals, it is important for a robotic soccer agent to have a clear policy about whether it should attempt to score in a given situation. Therefore we use reinforcement learning for optimizing policy. In the proposed method, the state spaces include two important parameters for shooting toward the goal; the distance between the ball and the goalkeeper and the probability which is obtained from the research of the UvA team. Of course, we select these parameters for effective features of scoring. Because they are more effective learning algorithm in real-time simulated soccer agent. Experimental results have shown that policy achieved from reinforcement learning lead to more effective shoots toward the goal in simulated soccer agent.

To compensate for adverse effects of those random communication constraints, an incremental networked predictive control scheme based on state observers is proposed. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the stability of the resulting closed-loop system, which is independent of random communication constraints. Experimental results on a networked multi-motor control test rig show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed scheme, including a feature that zero steady-state output tracking errors can be achieved even for the case with plant-model mismatch.
11|8407943|Conference Paper|2018|Jinran Wang|Event-Based Consensus Control of Multi-Agent Systems with Input Saturation Constraint|The event-based leader-following consensus problem for multi-agent systems with input saturation is studied in this paper. The control input update is event-driven, and the triggering function is linear, under the given trigger function and trigger condition. At first, a sufficient condition of the leader-following consensus for multi-agent systems without input saturation is presented. Furthermore, under the constraint of input saturation and communication time delay, the leader-following consensus control is achieved through designing control protocol and choosing suitable parameters of control input. Lyapunov function in combination with S-procedure method is adopted to prove the consensus stability for multi-agent systems with input saturation and communication time delay. Moreover, the Zeno-behavior is excluded for the triggering time sequence. Finally, simulations are present to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed consensus control protocols.

The users of the system do not need to input all of their schedules unlike the existing groupwares. When a user intends to call a meeting, he only inputs information about the meeting. On behalf of the inviter, mobile agents move around each invited user';s computer to ask whether he can join the meeting and negotiate with him if necessary. Therefore, the inviter';s work becomes less compared with using the existing groupwares.

Currently, there exists numerous articles and industrial reports describing various case studies of recent notable Advanced Persistent Threat attacks. However, these documents are expressed in natural language. This limits the efficient reusability of the threat intelligence information due to ambiguous nature of the natural language. In this article, we propose a model to formally represent Advanced Persistent Threats as multi-agent systems. Our model is inspired by the concepts of agent-oriented social modelling approaches, generally used for software security requirement analysis.

Maglog which is implemented in Java environments is taken up as an example of the agent runtime environment. Maglog consists of three basic components, which are agents, agent servers and fields. Agent server and fields are corresponding to agent runtime environments. The persistency is used for the following two purposes. One is for suspending agents. The other is for suspending a system which is developed by using Maglog. For example, when a computer will be stopped while a system is running, agents are suspended then their suspended state is stored. Subsequently, the agent server is suspended then the suspended state and fields are stored. When the system is restarted, first, the agent server resumes then the agents resume.
11|9177838|Conference Paper|2020|P. Parsa|Combining Consensus and Tracking Errors in Sliding Mode Control of High Order Uncertain Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems|Controlling stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) is a promising branch of systems engineering owing to its ability to solve complex practical problems by taking inspiration from the social behavior of living organisms. Consensus on more than one state is a less considered problem in the framework of leader-following control of high-order uncertain nonlinear stochastic multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics. To this end, in this paper, a sliding surface integrates a tracking error polynomial with consensus error between states of the connected agents. Accordingly, a new distributed fuzzy sliding mode controller is designed for a class of stochastic multi-agent systems with partially unknown deterministic dynamics and unknown bounded stochastic dynamics. The proposed control protocol steers agents to reach agreement on states of the leader and concurrently approximates the unknown part of their deterministic dynamics by using fuzzy systems with adaptive parameters. In the sense of Lyapunov, it is proved that consensus error and all of the closed-loop signals of each agent are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in mean square. Under the designed controller, nonlinear closedloop experimental dynamics behave well in both tracking and reaching state consensus.

In this paper, we study the adaptation of multi-agent systems from the system level and describe a formal framework for multi-agent systems with adaptation capabilities. In the framework, agents are indirectly interconnected via roles and interaction protocols are defined as entities independent of agents and roles. Thus, agents, roles, and interaction protocols involved in multi-agent systems need not always adjust their behaviors or specifications to adapt to the changes of system structures and interaction protocols.
11|6957041|Conference Paper|2014|Amro M. Farid|Multi-agent system design principles for resilient operation of future power systems|Recently, the academic and industrial literature has coalesced around an enhanced vision of the electric power grid that is intelligent, responsive, dynamic, adaptive and flexible. One particularly emphasized ‚Äúsmart-grid‚Äù property is that of resilience where healthy regions of the grid continue to operate while disrupted and perturbed regions bring themselves back to normal operation. Multi-agent systems have recently been proposed as a key enabling technology for such a resilient control scheme. While the power system literature has often addressed multi-agent systems, many of these works did not have resilience as the central design intention. This paper now has a two-fold purpose. First, it seeks to identify a set of multi-agent system design principles for resilient coordination and control of future power systems. To that end, it draws upon an axiomatic design for large flexible engineering systems model which was recently used in the development of resilience measures. From this quantitative model, a set of design principles are easily distilled. Second, the paper assesses the adherence of existing multi-agent system implementations with respect to these design principles. The paper concludes that while many multi-agent systems have been developed for power grids, they have been primarily intended as the decentralization of a particular decision-making/control algorithm. Thus many of the works make only limited contributions to power grid resilience.

11|8787679|Conference Paper|2019|Ruofei Wang|Exact Delay Margin on Containment Control for Discrete-Time First-Order Multi-Agent Systems|In this paper, we investigate the containment control problem of discrete-time first-order unstable multi-agent systems with undirected fixed communication topologies and uncertain communication delays. In particular, we focus on the delay margin achieved by two kinds of containment protocols, one is P-type and the other is PD-type. We provide the exact expression of the delay margin and its explicit bound by optimizing the network coupling strengths within their allowable ranges. The results show that for a strictly unstable discrete-time first-order multi-agent system, its delay margin depends on the unstable pole location of each agent, as well as on the eigen-ratio of the network topologies. In addition, the delay margin can be enlarged by PD-type containment protocol with respect to P-type one. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.

Four kinds of impulsive effects are taken into account: 1) both the strengths of impulsive effects and the number of nodes injected with impulses are time dependent; 2) the strengths of impulsive effects occur according to certain probabilities and the number of nodes under impulsive control is time varying; 3) the strengths of impulses are time varying, whereas the number of nodes with impulses takes place according to certain probabilities; 4) both the strengths of impulses and the number of nodes with impulsive control occur according to certain probabilities. By utilizing the comparison principle, criteria are established for these different cases and a relationship between the frequencies (occurrence probabilities) of impulses and systems'; parameters is unveiled. Finally, an example for tracking control of robotic systems is provided to show the effectiveness of the presented results.
11|7148452|Conference Paper|2015|Vaishnavi Singhal|Distributed task allocation in dynamic multi-agent system|From the last two decades, Software agents are playing an important role in the field of Artificial intelligence and the Distributed Problem Solving. The properties of software agents like autonomy, reactivity, pro-activity and their social ability make them more center of focus for the real world problems. The accomplishment of any complex task is required to be done by the agents autonomously without any user intervention in order to achieve high reliability and adaptability. This paper mainly concentrates on the task allocation problem in multi-agent systems. Task Allocation is an important and challenging problem. This can be defined as the problem of allocating tasks among agents within a multi-agent system. Main objective of the task allocation problem is to maximize the number of successfully completed task and overall system utility without any conflict. To accomplish any complex task, agents negotiate, cooperate and coordinate with each other. Many researchers are working in the field of task allocation in multiagent systems. In this paper, various approaches of task allocation in multi-agent systems are discussed. The comparison of these approaches is also providing that lead to a discussion and motivation of the task allocation problem for multi-agent systems. This paper presents a hybrid approach for task allocation in dynamic multi-agent systems. The conclusion drawn from this survey is that, for dynamic multi-agent systems, the distributed task allocation is a better approach.

11|699025|Conference Paper|1998|D. Steiner|Industrial applications of multi-agent technology|One of the key advantages of multi-agent technology is the support it offers in integrating and coordinating heterogeneous systems in a distributed and open environment. This advantage is increasingly being put to use in industrial environments, in particular, where components are provided by different companies or groups. However, in order to effectively make use of this advantage, standards are required to guide the way in which agents interact and are managed. For this purpose, the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) was established, which released its first specification, FIPA 97, in October, 1997. The paper presents an overview of the FIPA agent standardisation activities as well as the industrial field trials making use of the FIPA 97 specifications.

12|5284350|Conference Paper|2009|Keinosuke Matsumoto|A Dependable Multi-agent System with Self-Diagnostic Function|This paper proposes a self-diagnosable multi-agent system. A self-diagnosable algorithm has been proposed for multi-agent systems. This conventional algorithm makes every agent diagnose all other agents, but it has a problem that the more agents are included in a system, the more communications traffic increases. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a framework of multi-agent system that divides and deals with in parallel domains for mutual diagnosis to mitigate the communications between agents. Our approach introduces middle agents that do not interaction with basic client agents and we have developed a dynamic highly structured system that dynamically reconstitutes system configuration. The proposed method has been applied to a multi-agent system that forms a circle autonomously. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method needs much less communications than the conventional one.

12|7397358|Conference Paper|2015|Francisco Cunha|JAT4BDI: An Aspect-Based Approach for Testing BDI Agents|Multi-agent systems (MAS) for software construction is an approach that has been applied to different and complex domains that require distributed and intelligent environments. A crucial concern related to MAS is how software agents based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model should be tested. An agent is an autonomous and pro-active entity that can exchange information with other agents distributed. Due these characteristics to create unit tests for agents is a big challenge. In the literature there are several approaches that tries to deal with such challenge, however, they do not provide mechanisms to assist developers in identifying errors and in how observe the internal state of agent elements (e.g. beliefs, goals, plans, events, messages) during the development process. Thus, this paper presents a new approach to testing BDI agents based on the aspect technology.

12|7306609|Conference Paper|2015|Tammy R. Fuller|Creating Complex Applications via Self-Adapting Autonomous Agents in an Intelligent System Framework|In this paper, we present a process, developed over years of practical commercial use, where applications accomplishing a wide variety of complex tasks are created from a common framework, through the use, recombination and iterative refinement of autonomous agents in a Multi-Agent Intelligent System. Driven by a need to solve real-world problems, our focus is to make businesses run more efficiently in an increasingly complex world of systems and software that must work together seamlessly. By listening closely to our customers'; problems, we discovered points of commonality, as well as patterns of anomalies related to the flow of data through communication channels and data processing systems, include accounting, inventory, customer relationship management, scheduling systems and many more. We solved their problems through the creation of an Intelligent System, where we defined and implemented software agents that were highly configurable, responsive in real-time and useable in various settings. Autonomous agents adhere to a standard format of three major components: the goal or triggering criteria, the action, and the adaptation response. Agents run within a common Intelligent System framework and agent libraries provide a vast set of component behaviors to build applications from. Agents have one or more of the following component behaviors: sensory aware, geo-position aware, temporally aware, API aware, device aware, and many more. Additionally, there are manager-level agents whose goal is to keep the overall system in balance, through dynamic resource allocation on a system level. To prove the viability of this process, we present a variety of applications representing wide ranging behaviors, many with overlapping agents, created via this approach, all of which are in active commercial use. Finally, we discuss future enhancements toward self-organization, where end users express their requirements declaratively to solve larger business needs, resulting in the automatic instantiation of a solution specific intelligent system.

12|7066633|Conference Paper|2014|Nurzeatul Hamimah Abdul Hamid|Trusting norms in normative multi-agent systems|Research in normative multi-agent systems (NorMAS) have progressed from norm representation towards investigation of mechanisms in social sciences to support for agents'; tasks in open multi-agent systems (open-MAS) settings. Open-MAS characteristics pose new challenges in regulating and coordinating agents'; behavior. Norms are no longer assumed to be built into agents during design time, but emerged from interactions with other agents. These developments entail the needs to discover other factors that influence agents'; reasoning and decision-making for norms execution in open systems. In this paper, we explore and review the general concepts of norms in normative multi-agent systems, its classifications and life cycles. We then discuss and propose norm';s trust as an important factor which influences an agent';s norms compliance behavior and norms stability in normative multi-agent systems.

This revealed requirements for effective multi-agent mixed-initiative interactions, including the role of explanation and the need for contextual information sharing among the agents.
12|6391008|Conference Paper|2012|Song Yunzhong|Leader follower multi-agents network with discrete-time rendezvous via swarm social system strategies|In order to touch upon the rendezvous problems of leader follower multi-agents system with discrete time, three different kinds of strategies, namely the democracy strategy, the autarchy strategy as well as the mixed strategy were suggested based on the social system of the swarm of the multi-agents system, whereas the last strategy was composed of the democracy one and the autarchy one. It was found that among this arena, agents were finally divided into four different categories, that they were the agent where they represented the targeted object, the leader agents where they played the leading roles and the following agents where they had some connections with the leader ones and the follower agents where they were failed in connection with the leader ones, i.e. the isolated following agents. It was assumed that only the leader agents were capable of knowing the details of the global task, which was to come to the same targeted object, for the follower agents, if they were kept connected with the corresponding leader ones, they could also realize the rendezvous task in indirect ways. Results demonstrated that, the democracy strategy could fulfill the rendezvous task in an easiest way in expenses with a long convergent time and the autocracy democracy could come to the targeted object quickly with the cost of the risk of failing in completing the rendezvous task of the isolated follower agents, while the mixed strategy cared about both of the convergent speed and the utmost task, would take autocracy strategy when the connections were available for the follower agents to the leader ones, and the democracy rules had to be used when the connection to the leader agents was not possible. Compared with the first order model, the controlled variable of the second order contained a velocity variable, which made the vibration amplitude of the trajectory change remarkably, and the isolated following agents start moving under the influence of their own velocity. The models structure were provided to elucidate the specifications of the three strategies and they were explained even further with simulation work under the leader follower agent network which consisted of 4 leader agents and 5 follower agents.

The coordination goal to make each follower track the corresponding leader asymptotically where only a small fraction of followers can sense the states of their corresponding leaders on some disconnected time intervals. A novel adaptive intermittent control protocol is introduced, where only intermittent relative local information is used. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and M-matrix theory, some novel and simple criteria are derived for node-to-node consensus of multi-agent systems under the condition that only a small fraction of followers can sense their corresponding leaders and the measure of communication is larger than a threshold value. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

12|6251234|Conference Paper|2012|Kun Zhang|Interactive learning of social agents based on confidence degree|In Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), plural autonomous agents are able to acquire cooperative behavior by learning process. It is useful for agents to learn experience by sharing policies of others. However, in the normal Reinforcement Learning (RL), heterogeneous agents are difficult to acquire useful experience from others directly, because they have different characteristics and their actions would bring different effects. It is necessary for heterogeneous social agents to obtain suitable experience during the interaction with others. In our proposal, each agent learns not only the experience to adapt itself to environment, but also the suitable experience from other agents. When agents are learning by trial and error, the confidence to others is formed by learning process. The confidence is useful to select the suitable experience from various experience, and will be refreshed after each trial learning. Interactive relationship among social agents will be shown based on the confidence degree. After interactive learning processes, social agents will acquire the better cooperative performance than using normal RL method.

MAS are distributed systems and there is no central control for the agents in most of the systems. The lack of central control and the local view of each agent from the whole system may cause some unexpected behaviors which is called emergent behavior. Detecting and fixing these unexpected behaviors is more valuable and cost effective in the requirement and design phases rather than the implementation. In this paper, a method for the detection of emergent behaviors in MAS focusing on analysis phase of MaSE methodology and fixing them in the design phase is presented. The contributions of this work are investigating a specific type of emergent behaviors, the detection of them in MaSE methodology, and proposing solutions for the detected emergent behaviors. The details and the architecture of the system are presented. The method and how to apply this on MaSE is shown along with a case study followed by the discussion part.

13|5228085|Conference Paper|2009|Vivek Kumar Singh|Agent based models of social systems and collective intelligence|Agent-based modeling and simulation techniques have now become a suitable and popularly used approach to build useful models of social systems, which not only helps to get better understanding of various social phenomena but also enriches the agent-based computing paradigm in return. Agent-based models allow simulating social units such as individuals, households, organizations or nations and their direct or indirect interactions. These models demonstrate how global order and collective intelligence can emerge from relatively simple local interactions and can explain the dynamics of the emergent behaviour. The agent-based modeling approach has provided the bridging link between psychological &amp; sociological analysis of individual and social behaviours respectively, which was otherwise missing. This generative, proof-by-construction approach has also complemented the individual-centered research in cognitive science by showing that individual alone is not the crucial unit of cognition but is affected by environment and society besides affecting them as well. In this paper, we have given an analytical account of agent-based modeling of emergent collective social behaviours, on these lines, along with relevant theoretical &amp; experimental outcomes and their implications for multi-agent systems.

Usually, agents communicate with each other by using messages in a distributed system, hence a well formed and organized message structure might be the key point to get high quality of message transport between different agents. Clinical Document Architecture(CDA), which is a standard for clinical document information exchange, could convey more standardized clinical information to help physicians make much more accurate clinical decisions. In this paper, a document structure based on CDA is proposed as a message strcture for information exchange between different agents and it is proved flexible and efficient in the clinical information transportation and exchange. Through using the proposed message strcture, agents cooperate with each other much more efficiently, which could help doctors make much more scientific clinical decisions, reduce medical errors and then provide higer quality of heathcare.

13|9442841|Journal Article|2022|Vaibhav Kumar Singh|Finite-Dimensional Controllers for Consensus in a Leader-Follower Network of Marginally Unstable Infinite-Dimensional Agents|We consider the output-feedback state consensus problem for a homogeneous multi-agent system consisting of one leader agent and N follower agents. The dynamics of each of these agents is governed by a single-input single-output regular linear system (RLS), with the input to the leader agent being zero at all times. The transfer function of this RLS has all its poles in the closed left-half of the complex-plane, with only a finite number of them lying on the imaginary axis. Each follower agent can access the relative output of all its neighboring agents and some of the follower agents can access the relative output of the leader. The communication graph associated with the exchange of relative outputs is directed. Under this setting, we first establish that a controller solves the above leader-follower consensus problem if and only if it can simultaneously stabilize N regular linear systems. We then adapt a recently developed frequency-domain technique to construct a stable finite-dimensional output-feedback controller which solves the simultaneous stabilization problem, and hence the consensus problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our controller design technique using a numerical example.

13|9180272|Journal Article|2021|Gang Wang|Distributed Consensus of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems With Mismatched Uncertainties and Unknown High-Frequency Gains|This brief addresses the distributed consensus problem of nonlinear multi-agent systems under a general directed communication topology. Each agent is governed by higher-order dynamics with mismatched uncertainties, multiple completely unknown high-frequency gains, and external disturbances. The main contribution of this brief is to present a new distributed consensus algorithm, enabling the control input of each agent to require minimal information from its neighboring agents, that is, only their output information. To this end, a dynamic system is explicitly constructed for each agent to generate a reference output. Theoretical and simulation verifications of the proposed algorithm are rigorously studied to ensure that asymptotic consensus can be achieved and that all closed-loop signals remain bounded.

Distances, intervals, and attain a height between elements of the group are maintained in accordance with the proportional law. The main result of this article is the study of the mathematical model of UAVs for collective motion along a given route. The results of modeling the agent and the system as a whole are given. The conclusions establish the possibility of applying the developed mathematical model of UAV to the task of managing collective motion.

Moreover, the protocol can speed up the environment of MATLAB, we take the system composed of seven agents as an example for simulation, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed protocol.
13|1565589|Conference Paper|2005|N. Shah|Exception diagnosis in open multi-agent systems|Open multi-agent systems (MAS) are decentralized and highly distributed systems that consist of a large number of loosely coupled autonomous agents. Diagnosing exceptions in such systems is a complex task due to the distributed nature of their data and their control. This complexity is exacerbated in open environments where independently developed autonomous agents interact with each other in order to achieve their goals. Inevitably, exceptions will occur in such MAS and these exceptions can arise at one of three levels, namely environmental, knowledge and social levels. In this paper we propose a novel exception diagnosis system that is able to analyse and detect exceptions effectively. The proposed architecture consists of specialised exception diagnosis agents called sentinel agents. The sentinel agents are equipped with knowledge of observable abnormal situations, and their underlying causes.

13|9332398|Conference Paper|2020|Qi Han|Leader-following consensus of multi-agent system with multiple leaders under formation control|In this article, the consensus problem of a multiagent system with multiple leaders under formation control is studied. Compared with the previous multi-agent research, this paper solves the formation control problem of multi-agent systems with the consideration of the connection relationship between followers and leaders. The Prim algorithm is used to cut the OFTML (One follower connects to multiple leaders) and redundant connections in the system, which not only reduces the communication traffic in the system, but also makes the leader maintain the connection of 1:n with followers. Convert the original communication topology graph with N leaders into a topology graph with N spanning trees. Then, an effective formation control protocol is proposed to ensure that the multiagent system reaches the desired position, and based on the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions to ensure the stability of the multi-agent system are obtained. Finally, numerical simulation is used to prove the correctness and validity of the theoretical results.
13|4407332|Conference Paper|2007|Salvatore Garruzzo|ISABEL: A Multi Agent e-Learning System That Supports Multiple Devices|This paper presents an agent-based e-Learning platform which allows the interaction between users and e-learning Web sites, providing students with useful suggestions about the available educational resources. In traditional agent- based e-learning systems, each student is supported by a student agent that interacts with a site agent associated to an e-learning site. However, in the case of large agent communities, the tasks of both the student and the site agent can result significantly heavy, even more if the student agents run on devices with limited resources. To face this issue, in this paper we propose a new multi-agent learning system, called ISABEL. When a student visits an e-learning site using a given device, a teacher agent associated with the site collaborates with some tutor agents associated with the student, in order to provide him with useful recommendations. Some experimental results show significant advantages obtained by ISABEL in terms of recommendation efficiency and effectiveness.

Due to the existence of nonidentical uncertainties, the multi-agent systems discussed in this paper are essentially heterogeneous. For the case where the communication graph is undirected and connected, based on the local state information of neighboring agents, distributed continuous static and adaptive consensus protocols are designed, under which the consensus error is uniformly ultimately bounded and exponentially converges to a small adjustable residual set.

The communication network topology is time-varying rather than switches among several fixed topologies. To track the active leader, a neighbor-based control of each following agent is designed by using local information. By use of stochastic analysis methods and Lyapunov theorem, conditions for tracking strategy are proposed. Under the proposed consensus protocols, it is shown that the tracking system is stochastically stable and the estimation errors converge to zero in mean square as well. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed control theory.

14|7122276|Journal Article|2016|Shize Su|Distributed Consensus Control of Multi-Agent Systems With Higher Order Agent Dynamics and Dynamically Changing Directed Interaction Topologies|In 2005, Ren and Beard, under the network connectivity assumption that the union of the directed interaction graphs contains a spanning tree frequently enough, proposed a control protocol to solve the distributed consensus control problem for a multi-agent system with first order integrator agent dynamics. The consensus control protocol for second order systems proposed by the same authors, Ren and Beard, requires that the switching directed interaction graph has a spanning tree at every time instant to guarantee consensus. In this technical note, we propose a distributed consensus control protocol which extends the first order system results of Ren and Beard to agents represented by a general higher order controllable linear system, under the same network connectivity assumption that the union of the directed interaction graphs contains a spanning tree frequently enough. We show that the consensus can be achieved asymptotically by the group of agents under our proposed distributed control protocol. Simulation study illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.
14|7436135|Conference Paper|2015|Hassan Dehghani Aghbolagh|Scaled consensus of multi-agent systems under time-varying delay|In recent years, multi-agent systems have drawn a lot of attention. Consensus problem of these systems has been extensively studied in the past decade. However, in a recent paper, the concept of scaled consensus was introduced. Unlike conventional consensus, agents reach different initial-state-dependent values. On the other hand, time delay is an important issue in networks of agents; hence, this paper introduces time-varying delay to the scaled consensus problem. Moreover, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach is adopted to check the stability of the system. The allowable delay value is computed using the resultant LMIs. In order to validate our findings, a numerical example is provided.

14|8540557|Conference Paper|2018|Masoud Mohammadian|Network Security Risk Assessment Using Intelligent Agents|Network security is an important issue in today';s world with existence of network systems that communicate data and information about all aspects of our life, work and business. Network security is an important issue with connected networks and data communication between organisations of that specialized in different areas. Network security engineers spend a considerable amount of time to investigate network for security breaches and to enhance the security of their networks and data communications on their networks. They use Attack Graphs (AGs) which are graphical representation of networks to assist them in analysing large networks. With increase size of networks and their complexity, the use of attack graphs alone does not provide the necessary risk analysis and assessment facilities. There is a need for automated intelligent systems such as multiagent systems to assist in analysing, assessing and testing networks. Network systems changes with the increase in the size of organisation and connectivity of network of organisations based on the business needs or organisational or governmental rules and regulations. In this paper a multi-agent system is developed assist in analysing interconnected network to identify security risks. The multi-agent system is capable of security network analysis to identify paths using an attack graph of the network under consideration to protect network systems, as the networks grow and change, against possible attacks. The multiagent system uses a model developed by Mohammadian [3] for converting AGs to Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to identify attack paths from attack graphs and perform security risk analysis. In this paper a novel decision-making approach using FCMs is employed.

14|7219397|Journal Article|2016|Frank L. Lewis|Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems: Reduced-Order Synchronization and Geometry|This technical note studies the geometry of multiple interacting heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS), where the agent dynamics may not be the same. A detailed geometric theory is given here based on the Kalman observable form decomposition and a further characterization of that portion of the leader';s dynamics that is hidden within the dynamics of each agent. The output regulator equations are expressed in the new coordinates and are seen to be composed of an observable part and an unobservable part. These new geometric ideas are used to design efficient reduced-order synchronizers that guarantee synchronization of the outputs of all agents to a leader. It is shown that synchronization of heterogeneous MAS can be achieved if each agent has a mix of a dynamic synchronizer for the part of the leader';s dynamics that is not contained in the agent';s dynamics, and a static feedback synchronizer for the part that is.
14|9460210|Conference Paper|2021|Ebert Schoofs|Software Agent-based Multi-Robot Development: A Case Study|The Internet of things (IoT) systems and cyber- physical systems (CPS) have lured various embedded technology from low-end to high-level devices, including sensors nodes, development boards, and model-based solutions to increase the development and prototyping of the target systems. Moreover, these systems'; heterogeneity problem and complexity require intelligent solutions where the multi-agent systems can be a solution. LEGO technology is a preferable methodology to emulate the complexity and heterogeneity problem of cyber-physical systems, which benefit from the IoT paradigm to establish network, communication and messaging. However, a methodology to integrate the software agents to control these LEGO-based complex and heterogeneous systems should be defined. Once embedded sensing, actuation, networking and control are merged with the agent- based programming, then this infrastructure can pave the way for applying intelligent and model-based solutions to tackle the high- level problems of CPS. In this paper, a case study is introduced to describe the LEGO technology-based cyber-physical systems and software agents'; integration. During the development of the convoy robot case study, a line follower robot followed by an adaptive cruise control robot is implemented. The case study design (both the system and software) is realized using SysML, and the implementation is done using Lego Bricks, RaspberryPi, and JADE agent programming language.

Many load forecasting methods have been developed in recent years which are usually complex solutions with many adjustable parameters. Best-matching models and their relevant parameters have to be determined in a search procedure. We propose a hybrid prediction model, where best exemplars from a possibly large set of different simple short-time load forecasting models are automatically selected based on their past performance by a multi-agent system with history-based weighting. The increase of prediction accuracy has been verified on real load data from the Polish power system.
14|699240|Conference Paper|1998|A. Loureiro da Costa|Dynamic social knowledge: a cognitive multi-agent system cooperation strategy|The adopted cooperation strategy is one of the most important aspects to make an agent community achieve a common goal. Basically there are two kinds of cooperation strategies for cognitive multi agent systems: contract net protocol and negotiation. Contract net protocol requires a small amount of knowledge about the other agents in the community, but it is not possible to persuade another agent to perform a given task or to join some agents in an agent group to perform a given task during a cooperation process. On the other hand, negotiation allows an agent to communicate directly with another agent. This direct communication allows agreements when the optimal solution is not available, but the required amount of social knowledge and the communication overhead needed to update it is much greater than in the contract net protocol. A new cooperation strategy for open cognitive autonomous multi agent systems, called Dynamic Social Knowledge is proposed. This strategy combines the advantages of both contract net protocol and negotiation, and makes intensive use of rule based reasoning.

Then, a proper linear transformation is proposed to transform the consensus problem of the new system into a partial stability problem of corresponding auxiliary system. Meanwhile, we design the gain matrix of the protocol by solving a bilinear matrix inequality via the path-following method. Numerical examples of directed and undirected information topologies are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Each agent is strong coupling with its neighbors by the historical outputs. All agents are interacted either directly or indirectly. In the face of uncertainties, the projection algorithm as a normal adaptive method is adopted. In order to improve quality of identification, the multi-model method is taken to identify unknown parameters and high-frequency gains using switching sets of the multiple parameters'; and high-frequency gains'; estimates, and the index switching functions. Using the certainty equivalence principle, the control law for the hidden leader agent is designed by the desired reference signal; the control law for each follower agent is devised by neighbors'; historical outputs. Moreover, the proposed decentralized adaptive control laws can guarantee the following performances of the system: (1) the leader agent tracks the reference trajectory and each follower agent follows the average value of its neighborhood historical outputs; (2) the synchronization of all the follower agents to the leader agent is achieved; (3) all the agents track the reference trajectory, and the closed-loop system eventually achieves strong synchronization. Finally, simulations validate the effectiveness on improving control performance of multi-model adaptive algorithm by comparing with the projection algorithm.

15|8075683|Conference Paper|2017|Asma Garrab|A multi-agent system control of a smart grid located at a distribution level|Current electric power grids in nowadays are facing many issues as: the power balance, reliable electricity supply, reduction of energy prices, and the integration of distributed energy resources. Conventional electric grids cannot handle with these problems. Current trend to monitor and control the power grid is Multi-Agent System (MAS). In this work, we aim to demonstrate the efficiency of the implementation of MAS in a microgrid to protect and manage its operation. The connection between the MAS and microgrid is achieved using Multi-Agent Control for Simulink (MACSimJx) toolbox. Simulation results proved that MAS has isolated the primary power source when a fault is occurred, and has protected the critical load. Also, it shows that the duration where the critical loads are off power has been reduced.
15|7978106|Conference Paper|2017|Xinbiao Lu|Flocking control of multi-agents based on self-adaptively weighting observers driven only by local position measurements|The most methods to achieve flocking control of multi-agent systems take both position and speed information of all the multi-agents into the control laws. However, various factors and their magnitudes, related to mutual position difference vectors, between the multi-agents are neglected. In this paper, based on distributed observers, flocking control algorithms driven only by local position measurements and with self-adaptively weighting coefficients are proposed. The suggested algorithms are sketched as follows. Firstly, distributed observers are introduced to each individual agent to estimate its speed only by local position measurements of the agents locating in the corresponding neighborhoods. Secondly, by self-adaptively adjusted weighting coefficients to the observers, possible attraction/dispersion force variations caused by position measurement uncertainties are exploited for facilitating flocking formation. Moreover, major properties of the suggested flocking algorithms are analyzed rigorously, and numerical simulations are shown to verify effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

15|6716068|Journal Article|2014|Jianxiang Xi|Guaranteed-Cost Consensus for Singular Multi-Agent Systems With Switching Topologies|Guaranteed-cost consensus problems for high-order singular multi-agent systems with switching topologies are investigated. Firstly, to achieve a trade-off design object between consensus regulation performances and control energy consumptions, a quadratic cost function is constructed by state errors among agents and control inputs of all agents and guaranteed-cost consensus problems are introduced. Then, based on linear matrix inequality techniques, sufficient conditions for guaranteed-cost consensus and consensualization are presented respectively, which can guarantee the scalability of singular multi-agent systems since the dimensions of all the variables in these conditions are independent of the number of agents. Moreover, an upper bound of the cost function is determined, explicit expressions of consensus functions are given on the basis of the Second Equivalent Form, and it is shown that consensus functions are dependent on the average of initial states of all agents but are independent of switching topologies. Finally, the applications of theoretical results in multi-agent supporting systems are shown.

15|8540548|Conference Paper|2018|Shahidatul Nadhirah Mansor|An Emotional Agent for the Analysis of Customer Satisfaction Surveys|There are many studies that attempt to formulate emotions in software agents. The ability of software agents to know the type of conditions that generate emotional states regarding a particular behaviour or event require a specific domain knowledge and emotion mechanisms. Meanwhile, analyzing the Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSS) of particulars such as a company, brand, item, product or service reveal the customers'; emotions regarding these particulars. Subsequently, this paper proposes an emotional agent model for the analysis of the CSS. The Emotional Analysis of Customer Satisfaction Survey (EA-CSS) model deploys an emotional agent to observe customers'; feedback of a particular product or service. The agent captures and aggregates the feedback of each item of the survey individually and produces a comprehensive emotional state. This approach of analysis can be viewed online to customers, stakeholders and managers for further actions.

A demo has been developed by us in order to simulate a geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system. The paper aims at showing the geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system architecture together with the development issues. The results of the experimental campaign are also presented.

Mackin|Evolving intelligent multiagent systems using unsupervised agent communication and behavior training|Multiagent systems in which independent software agents interact with each other to achieve common goals, complete distributed tasks concurrently under autonomous control. Agent communication has been shown to be an important factor in coordinating efficient group behavior in agents. Most research on training or evolving group behavior in multiagent systems used predefined agent communication protocols. Designing agent communication becomes a complex problem in dynamic and large-scale systems. In order to solve this problem, in our previous research we proposed a method applying genetic programming techniques, in particular Automatically Defined Function Genetic Programming (ADF-GP) (K. Mackin and E. Tazaki, 1999), to allow agents to autonomously learn effective agent communication messaging. For this research we take this approach further and combine training of the agent behavior as well as the communication protocol. By training both behavior and communication we expect to further optimize the system performance. A software simulation of a multiagent transaction system is used to observe the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Centralized algorithms can maximize coordination efficiency as it has global information. However, these algorithms have few critical problems such as a single point of failure (SPOF) problem. To the best of our knowledge, no papers directly tackle this issue but propose decentralized approaches, which can only achieve suboptimal efficiency. In this paper, we provide RECEN, a new resilient Mobile Adhoc NETwork (MANET) based centralized architecture using a Mobile Agent system (MAS). A mobile agent is a software process that can migrate from one machine to another while continuing its tasks on the new platform. Applying this technique in MRSs, a master agent can migrate to different robots when facing hardware issues while continuously manages its slave robots efficiently with Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) algorithm. In order to verify improved resilience by RECEN, our simulation compares RECEN with a general centralized MRS. The result shows that the performance of RECEN outweighs a general centralized MRS by completing 10000 (maximum number of tasks) and 141.42 tasks respectively with 10 robots when there is no sudden accident that causes robot failure before migration. Taking such accidents into account, the simulation result reports that RECEN completes 2768.34 tasks on average with the same number of robots. Moreover, our multi-robot surveillance application in real world environment demonstrates resilience of RECEN by continuously managing slave robots despite hardware issues in a master robot.

C isotope separation column cascade. The multi- agent system was implemented using the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) platform which allows the parameterization of the characteristics of each agent running on the system. The JADE platform is compliant with the FIPA specifications for the interoperability of heterogeneous agents. The operational model of the isotope separation column cascade is implemented in Matlab/SIMULINK and is linked to the multi-agent control system operating in JADE using MACSimJX (Multiagent Control Using Simulink with Jade Extension). The process output variables from the sensors are sent to the agents for control signal computation and after agent operation in JADE the necessary control signals are sent back to the actuators in Matlab. Several simulation scenarios were performed to demonstrate the feasibility and the possible benefits of this control architecture.

Integral to this architecture is the separation of part processing concerns from manufacturing concerns. Thus we have part agents which are able to issue and track resource-independent part-processing requests.

Execution of the dispatched requests then proceeds autonomously, taking into account safety constraints. We also describe an implementation of this architecture targeted for a robotic assembly cell, located at the University of Cambridge.

Therefore, we present an ontology solution based on the knowledge management system for semantic heterogeneity. The proposed solution prevents the misunderstanding during the negotiation process though the agents'; communications. Our approach aims to facilitate, to automate the communications and to make the agents able to understand each other when using these ontologies. Thus, we propose a general architecture for Negotiation process which uses Ontology-based Knowledge Management System (NOKMS). This architecture consists of three layers: the Negotiation Layer (NL) that describes the negotiation process between the Initiator Static Agents (ISAs) and the Participant Mobile Agents (PMAs) by using suitable ontologies, the Semantic Layer (SEL) contains the semantic translator which uses in the case of misunderstanding of the sent messages between the agents, and the last one is the Knowledge Management Systems Layer (KMSL) which bases on the Intelligent Knowledge Base (IKB) to give the flexibility to our negotiation ontology. We will try to apply our architecture on the Multimodal Transport Information System (MTIS) project where we will use an agent architecture in our proposal NOKMS to improves the execution of negotiation process in multi-agents systems which use different ontologies in order to satisfy the transport customers.

The paper illustrates a novel distributed protocol for multi agent environments to improve the communication security in packet-switched networks. To enrich the overall system security the approach makes use of distribution and double encryption and some other traditional methods such as digital signature. In this approach the encrypted private key and the message are broken into different parts carrying by different agents which makes it difficult for malicious entities to mine the private key for message encryption, while the private key for the encrypted key is allocated on the predetermined destination nodes. On the other hand, all of the previously proposed encryption algorithms can be applied in the proposed approach that deteriorates the key discovery process. To improve the overall security, the paper makes use of advanced encryption standard (AES) as the encryption base for message encryption. The paper also presents some evaluation discussions presenting time overhead analysis and crack probability.

These instruments are mostly a set of sensors aiming to collect data from the environment called theater. This set of sensors offers a large panel of functions to the platform';s manager during the flight. We will see in this article how the needs'; transformation as well as the numerous environment constraints turn the design of the architecture of the multi-sensors system into a complex task.

Then, we will propose a generic agent-based architecture which takes into account the aforesaid constraints.
16|7999353|Conference Paper|2016|Przemyslaw Trojan|Agent-based power system management ‚Äî Concept of grid restoration|After the blackout state, system operators must do all necessary action in order to restore the supply to disconnected loads. Grid restoration process can be formulated as optimization problem which encompasses status assessment, optimization of generation capability and load pickup. A specific restoration strategy is determined by a combination of the actions and operational constraints based on the actual system conditions. Since centralized approach requires intensive data processing and it may be time consuming, a new approach based on multi-agent systems has been presented. Due to inherent benefits of multi-agent systems such as increased autonomy, reactivity, proactivity and social abilities, it is possible to perform grid restoration processes in intelligent way on the one hand and ensure fulfillment of operational requirements of a system on the other hand. Through appropriate organization of data exchange, an efficient decision supporting tool for assessing the power system capabilities and the optimal grid restoration strategy can be proposed, which translates into improving the system reliability.

16|7058448|Journal Article|2015|Peng Shi|Cooperative Control of Multi-Agent Systems With Unknown State-Dependent Controlling Effects|This paper investigates the cooperative control problem of uncertain high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems on directed graph with a fixed topology. Each follower is assumed to have an unknown controlling effect which depends on its own state. By the Nussbaum-type gain technique and the function approximation capability of neural networks, a distributed adaptive neural networks-based controller is designed for each follower in the graph such that all followers can asymptotically synchronize the leader with tracking errors being semi-globally uniform ultimate bounded. Analysis of stability and parameter convergence of the proposed algorithm are conducted based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov theory. Finally, a example is provided to validate the theoretical results. Note to Practitioners-Many practical applications can be modeled as uncertain high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems, whose node'; controlling effects are state-dependent. In most relevant literatures, however, it is often assumed that each node'; controlling effects are equal to one. How to cooperative control for the systems has become one main focus of control researches. Therefore, in this paper, an adaptive cooperative control scheme is proposed for such multi-agent systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the control strategies is illustrated via simulation study.

Ajitha|Optimal travel management using software agent|The software agents and multi-agent systems will be one of the landmark technologies in computer science that will bring extra theoretical power, methods and techniques that will broaden the field of computer applications. The objective of this paper is to use the software agents for extracting data from different sources intelligently and provide an optimal travel plan for a traveler. Planning for a travel requires collecting a wide range of data from number of sources, which includes details about schedules of flights, ticket prices, hotel accommodation, locations, travel expenses etc. Nowadays a lot of such information';s are available on the Internet. These data can be used to facilitate the travelers for planning and executing their trips in a better way. The agents have used the Tabu search algorithm for finding the optimal value. We have used JADE platform to implement the application. These agents we designed in this model will search the knowledge base in-order to obtain the data. These data collected by the different agents helps to build an interactive travel planning application which helps for a successful travel.

17|8217910|Conference Paper|2017|Xiaotian Hao|Effective norm emergence in cell systems under limited communication|The cooperation of cells in biological systems is similar to that of agents in cooperative multi-agent systems. Research findings in multi-agent systems literature can provide valuable inspirations to biological research. The well-coordinated states in cell systems can be viewed as desirable social norms in cooperative multi-agent systems. One important research question is how a norm can rapidly emerge with limited communication resources. In this paper, we propose a learning approach which can trade off the agents'; performance of coordinating on a consistent norm and the communication cost involved. During the learning process, the agents can dynamically adjust their coordination set according to their own observations and pick out the most crucial agents to coordinate with. In this way, our method significantly reduces the coordination dependence among agents. The experiment results show that our method can efficiently facilitate the social norm emergence among agents, and also scale well to large-scale populations.

The robustness property of proposed controller is also checked by applying a slowly varying disturbance. Finally, a numerical example is presented to endow the efficacy of the proposed methods.

And the program was developed using JADE (Java Agent Development Framework) which is one of the helpful and convenient develop environment of MAS. The framework realizes the functions of the generation scheduling and the control of the voltage and the frequency.

However, this formalism cannot be easily refined into implementation even if some counter-examples exist. This work proposes another type of formalism called cooperative objects which are based on Petri nets and objects. We show how it may be used with benefits to model multi-agent systems. More precisely, we argue that the presented formalism can bridge the gap between the world of formal theory and the world of system development. We illustrate our study with the well known prey/predators game.

17|9317712|Journal Article|2021|Qinglai Wei|Consensus Control of Leader-Following Multi-Agent Systems in Directed Topology With Heterogeneous Disturbances|This paper investigates the consensus problem for linear multi-agent systems with the heterogeneous disturbances generated by the Brown motion. Its main contribution is that a control scheme is designed to achieve the dynamic consensus for the multi-agent systems in directed topology interfered by stochastic noise. In traditional ways, the coupling weights depending on the communication structure are static. A new distributed controller is designed based on Riccati inequalities, while updating the coupling weights associated with the gain matrix by state errors between adjacent agents. By introducing time-varying coupling weights into this novel control law, the state errors between leader and followers asymptotically converge to the minimum value utilizing the local interaction. Through the Lyapunov directed method and It√¥ formula, the stability of the closed-loop system with the proposed control law is analyzed. Two simulation results conducted by the new and traditional schemes are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the developed control method.

Numerical simulation shows the performance of the proposed consensus protocols.

17|6595620|Journal Article|2014|Meng Guo|Controlling the Relative Agent Motion in Multi-Agent Formation Stabilization|In this technical note, we propose a novel technique to control the relative motion of multiple mobile agents as they stabilize to a desired configuration. In particular, we focus on the agents'; relative velocities and the rate of change of their pairwise distances, and employ constructs from classic navigation functions (NFs) to control these quantities. Controlling agent velocities requires nontrivial extensions of the NF methodology to second-order models. Although in this work we propose a centralized framework to control the relative agent velocities, it adds a new dimension to the control of multi-agent systems with several advantages. In particular, we provide a novel approach to control the transient dynamics of a network that may facilitate the integration of continuous motion planing with discrete topology control. The result is verified theoretically and via computer simulations.

Efforts have been made to design the best evacuation plans using simulations and modeling of certain evacuation scenarios, in order to help prepare for the actual event. In some scenarios where the majority of evacuees are not familiar with the layout of the building, evacuees most familiar with the layout of the building should be appointed as group leaders. These leaders guide their evacuee group to safety, usually outside the building. This research employs leader-following behaviour, and multi-agent system with Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) for navigation, thus creating leader-follower relationship between evacuees. Each evacuees, i.e. follower, tries to navigate to follow their respective group leader to reach their escape point together. Experiment results demonstrate the navigation of hundreds of agents in an evacuation scenario, which shows that the evacuees safely reached the evacuation point between 92.597 to 129.71 seconds.

In addition, the consensus problem of a group of non-identical pendulums is studied and the distributed cooperative tracking can be achieved under the algorithm.
18|7983935|Conference Paper|2016|Soukaina Boudoudouh|Continuous control by Multi Agent System in PV-battery system|MacsimJX is an interface that enables communication between Simulink and a Multi Agent System (MAS) created by Jade. The need to develop MacsimJX is to ensure stability to liaise S-functions of Simulink by a multi-threaded program like the example of MAS, where each agent represents a thread. MAS is widely used in several fields, but its sampled feature makes the control of dynamics systems with continuous states quite complex. This is due to the discontinuous nature of the control algorithm. This paper proposes an effective way to control decentralized systems by MAS reacting in an environment that depends on continuous functions. To illustrate the potential of the hypothesis, a case study is presented.

The proposed MAS approach controls a large heavily-meshed distribution network which is grouped into small subnetworks using Œµ decomposition. The voltage regulation is accomplished by distributed generator (DG) agents, linear programming solver (LPS) agents, network violation detector (NVD) agents, and one Œµ decomposition agent. The LPS agent has an embedded control algorithm which optimizes DG generation within a subnetwork once the voltage at particular nodes exceeds the normal operational limits. The subnetworks and their control requirements are achieved through self-organization, which is the novelty of the research. Each intelligent agent has its own knowledge and reasoning logic to plan its own activities. The control actions are coordinated through agent communications within the subnetwork. The agent platform, Presage2, with improved autonomy and agent communication capability, has been used to develop the proposed MAS system and design the agents'; behaviors.

It provides a new paradigm to application developers as the real strength of agents can only be realized when they become mobile. We have proposed a mechanism to achieve intra-platform and inter-platform agent migration in a multi-agent system by customizing agent communication channel module. We have evaluated our proposed solution in comparison with remote method invocation (RMI) and found it to be efficient and scalable. It supports the existing features of core agent systems and provides an additional opportunity to employ mobile agents by the application developers.

This method is unified and different from the existing tools: the Laplacian matrix based method and the Lyapunov';s method. It treats the multi-agent system as the composition of many isolated agents and focuses on their input and output relationship. Then, the stability analysis is recursive and independent of the specific topology.

In order to eliminate continuous communication between neighboring agents, the controller is designed by using state estimates of neighboring agents instead of their real states. The communication instants are determined by the developed event-triggered strategy to minimize the amount of communication between neighbors. A Lyapunov-based cooperation error convergence analysis has been provided to indicate the bounded convergence of the proposed control algorithm. Finally, a simulation case has been given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
18|5367091|Conference Paper|2009|Jichen Yang|Flocking of Multi-agent Systems with Non-smooth Control|This paper analyzes the stability of a multi-agent system following a virtual leader. The velocity of the leader is time-varying and its acceleration is not known. The interconnection topology of position network switches based on the distances between agents and the velocity graph topology switches arbitrarily. These changes introduce discontinuities in the agent control laws. To track the leader in flocking, a neighbor-based local piecewise smooth controller is proposed for each agent. Using the control method, all agent velocities asymptotically approach the desired velocity while collisions can be avoided between agents. Some simulation results are provided to demonstrate theoretical results.

A key collaboration challenge is making complex ecosystems composed of robots, agents, and humans function together to achieve an overarching task. To do this requires both teamwork and mutual understanding between humans and software agents. As these systems scale up in size, effective data analytics and network science become critical towards understanding and guiding systems operation. My premise is that the same techniques that are useful for studying human social systems are also for studying these semi-artificial systems. In this talk I present two case studies of combining and analyzing human and agent systems in new and innovative ways.

By adjusting feedback gains online, the stability of multi-agent system is guaranteed against uncertainties of parameters. We assume that there is neither leader nor virtual leader providing the target of state values for all agents. Then, a common target for all agents is decided by a distributed approach. By the control inputs, the state values of all agents converge to the common target, and consensus is achieved.

Megherbi|A collaborative distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning technique for dynamic agent shortest path planning via selected sub-goals in complex cluttered environments|Collaborative monitoring of large infrastructures, such as military, transportation and maritime systems are decisive issues in many surveillance, protection, and security applications. In many of these applications, dynamic multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning for agents'; autonomous path planning, where agents could be moving randomly to reach their respective goals and avoiding topographical obstacles intelligently, becomes a challenging problem. This is specially so in a dynamic agent environment. In our prior work we presented an intelligent multi-agent hybrid reactive and reinforcement learning technique for collaborative autonomous agent path planning for monitoring Critical Key Infrastructures and Resources (CKIR) in a geographically and a computationally distributed systems. Here agent monitoring of large environments is reduced to monitoring of relatively smaller track-able geographically distributed agent environment regions. In this paper we tackle this problem in the challenging case of complex and cluttered environments, where agents'; initial random-walk paths become challenging and relatively nonconverging. Here we propose a multi-agent distributed hybrid reactive re-enforcement learning technique based on selected agent intermediary sub-goals using a learning reward scheme in a distributed-computing memory setting. Various case study scenarios are presented for convergence study to the shortest minimum-amount-of-time exploratory steps for faster and efficient agent learning. In this work the distributed dynamic agent communication is done via a Message Passing Interface (MPI).

19|8270547|Conference Paper|2017|Mara Pudane|Classification of agent-based models from the perspective of multi-agent systems|Agent based modelling is a paradigm that is widely used to simulate and research systems where each entity is autonomous and behaves independently. Currently, there are many diverse agent based models, however, aside from general guidelines there are no particular analysis of how such models should be designed and implemented. On the other hand, any agent based model can be broken into a single agent and a system level; these abstraction levels are used in the design of multi-agent systems, moreover, agent based models are often implemented using mechanisms and tools from multi-agent systems. Author proposes that one of the ways this problem could be solved is classification of agent-based models from the perspective of multi-agent systems which is then used to provide decision support for the design of agent-based models.

The high-order consensus of complex networks are particularly targeted. This result helps investigate large scale multi-agent networks.

Finally, the evolution process of multi-objective cooperative co-evolutionary strategies in agents is analyzed for constructing new multi-objective cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms for this problem in the future.
19|6188413|Conference Paper|2012|Dalila B. Megherbi|Cooperation in a distributed hybrid potential-field/reinforcement learning multi-agents-based autonomous path planning in a dynamic time-varying unstructured environment|Multi-agent modeling and simulation are crucial for many applications including military ones, such as battlefield modeling and simulation. In a dynamic time-varying environment multi-agent reinforcement learning for agent path-planning, where mobile agents and obstacles move randomly, becomes a challenging problem. This is due to the fact that what a given agent learned, during its past states in time, prior to achieving its current present state may become obsolete and irrelevant at the current agent state. This is due to the agent';s time-varying changes in its dynamic time-varying environment. In particular, in such dynamic environment it is desired to have agent(s) not only be equipped with intelligence to avoid other agents and moving obstacles but also be able to learn the shortest path to the goal in a minimum amount of runs. This paper presents a reinforcement-learning-based technique which allows an agent (s) to converge to the shortest path in a small number of runs of two. We use a combination of potential field and reinforcement learning to solve this problem. When used alone these two approaches have their limitations. Here we propose an approach that we name ‚Äúdissolving potential field‚Äù and ‚Äúselective reinforcement learning‚Äù in a time-varying agent';s environment. The paper describes a method based on these two approaches combined, such that it guides the agent(s) to accomplish its (their) goals in a dynamically varying and changing environment.

We try to improve existing approaches by using multiple techniques in a multi-layer system where learners and tutors with the help of automatic agents collaborate to find the best answer to the submitted question.
20|8466167|Conference Paper|2017|I. Sharifi|Multi-lateral Nonlinear Time-Delayed Teleoperation in a Multi-agent Systems Framework|In this paper, the issue of non-linear multi-lateral teleoperation has been considered. The multifaceted nature of controller designation for multi-lateral teleoperation frameworks increment by increasing the quantity of operators. The multiagent System (MAS) based structure is presented as a solution to this issue. The MAS-based framework focuses in light of structures that many intelligent and smart agent interact with each other. A sort of self-intelligence exists inside every agents; implying that each of them knows how different agents are working in the system. Along these lines, the strategy in this paper has some preferences over multi-lateral structure in conventional teleoperation frameworks. In light of the MAS structure, a brought together structure will deal with the overall system. Thusly, there is no compelling reason to upgrade the controller while exchanging the topography of multi-lateral framework. Besides, there is no constraint in the quantity of operators. Moreover, the structure of the proposed controller is to such an extent that some scenarios about the behavior of the operators can be characterized and used in practical manners. At long last, this paper presents a structure for concurrent training and therapy in multi-lateral rehabilitation frameworks as a case study. In this framework, a specialist therapist, various understudy learners and a patient interact with each other to perform both patient recovery and student training. Experiments are done to affirm the performance in presence of stability of the proposed system.

20|4721796|Conference Paper|2008|Xue Ligong|Application of Multi-agent in Intelligent Manufacturing System|Computer aided process planning (CAPP) plays an important role in the computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS). In recent years, the competition among manufacturers to reduce the development time of new products has been quite fierce. At the same time, customerspsila needs have become relatively diverse. Considering these facts, it is essential for manufacturers to build an assembly line in the shortest time possible. Because an assembly line for varied and complex products involves numerous workstations, assembly operations and resources, it is extremely difficult for assembly process planners to develop an efficient assembly sequence and position. Multi-agent technology has been considered as a efficient approach for developing process planning systems and optimizing process plans in a distributed environment. Thus, in order to overcome such complications, a new intelligent agent CAPP system is proposed in this paper. The multi-agent based system framework, in which various intelligent agents worked together to perform process planning in an autonomous and collaborative way, was put forward. The complex problem is divided into a few small sub problems, and each agent has own knowledge and reasoning. The system consisted of nine categories of agents and functional definition of each intelligent agent was presented. The system modeling, agent structure design and coordination mechanism are proposed.

20|4812756|Conference Paper|2009|Camila Nunes|Comparing Stability of Implementation Techniques for Multi-agent System Product Lines|Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly being exploited to support autonomous recommendation of products and information to contemporary application users. Multi-agent system product lines (MAS-PL) promote large-scale reuse of common and variable agency features across multiple MAS applications. The development of MAS-PLs can be achieved through alternative MAS-specific frameworks (JADE and Jadex), and general-purpose implementation techniques, such as aspect-oriented programming (AOP). However, there is not much evidence on how these techniques provide better modularity, allowing the conception of stable MAS-PL designs. This paper reports an empirical study that assesses the modularity of a MAS-PL through a systematic analysis of its releases. The study consists of a comparison among three distinct versions of this MAS-PL, each one implemented with a different technique: (i) Jadex platform and configuration files; (ii) JADE platform and configuration files; and (iii) JADE platform enriched with AOP mechanisms. Our analysis was driven by fundamental modularity attributes.

All agent outputs are required to track a leader output which is assumed as a desired value. By input-output feedback linearization, the nonlinear heterogeneous system is decomposed into equivalent linear systems and internal dynamics. Then a distributed auxiliary controller for every agent using local information is designed and a sufficient consensus condition is given under switching topologies with every possible topology containing a directed spanning tree. Furthermore, it is proved that the consensus can be achieved with the same condition for multi-agent systems under switching topologies frequently containing a directed spanning tree. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the control protocol.

The proposed control algorithms are based on the virtual leaders approach. The modifications of the base controls which ensures that agents avoid collisions and obstacles are considered in this paper. Specific rules that allow each agent to calculate the virtual leaders'; position and the priority of each leader are suggested.

Obstacle avoidance is implemented with the help of potential repulsive function. Based on the developed discrete-time algorithm, solution for maintaining formation and avoiding collisions and obstacles while moving towards the target point, is proposed. Simulation results are presented, indicating capabilities of the algorithms.

Therefore it shows a novel idea for the CASoSSWF which can provide conception models for a surface warship formation operation simulation system.

A decentralized estimation-based output feedback control protocol is put forward via the relative output measurements. A novel event-based mechanism is proposed for each intelligent agent to utilize the available information in order to decide when to broadcast messages and update control input. The aim of the problem addressed is to co-design the time-varying controller and estimator parameters such that the controlled multi-agent systems achieve consensus with a disturbance attenuation level Œ≥ over a finite horizon [0, T].

The major agent has salient impact on others. Each minor agent merely has tiny influence, while the average effect of all the minor agents is not negligible, which plays a significant role in the evolution and performance index of each agent. Besides the state of the major agent, each minor agent can only access to the information of its state and parameters. Based on the mean field theory, a set of distributed control laws is designed. By the probability limit theory, the uniform stability of the closed-loop systems and the upper bound of the corresponding index values are obtained.

This paper proposes a method to use individual-related data for process optimization and raise of acceptance of technology and at the same time keeping the data safe and giving the individual sovereignty over the use of its personal information. In this work a multi-agent system is used for the integration of humans in technical systems, where a special software agent keeps information about the dedicated human, like abilities and properties, and acts in favour of the human. To ensure the privacy of this data, the human can decide which data he wants to expose to the system to make it adapt to his needs. This allows the system to form socio-technical system consisting of humans and robot, where multi-robot systems, like a fleet of AGVs, can interact with the individual. Furthermore, blockchain technologies and databases are used to store the personal date after usage in a secure manner. The methods to safely share, store and transfer personal information in robotics and automation application are described in the following.

First, five agents are used as controlled objects, and all five agents form a ‚Äúleader-follower‚Äù mode with a distributed control structure. Meanwhile, the leader';s moving velocity is considered the forward velocity of the whole formation system, and remaining agents follow the leader';s movement. Then, each agent tracks the desired formation with a time-varying reference trajectory, thereby achieving the consensus tracking purpose of multi-agent system. Moreover, the multi-agent formation system avoids obstacles with the optimal trajectory and maintains the desired formation movement. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed controller can achieve the lateral and horizontal tracking errors of the multi-agent system to converge quickly, and then keep the system asymptotically stable during tracking process.

21|825410|Conference Paper|1999|W.A. Alford|Multi-agent system for a human-friendly robot|At the Center for Intelligent Systems, we are working on human robot interaction (HRI). We present our approach for HRI. Our goals for HRI are to allow the human to influence the robot';s actions in some way and acquire feedback about the robot';s internal state. Additionally, we would like the robot to confirm the human';s input and request the human';s assistance if necessary.

This limited conversation included commands to the robot and queries about the robot';s abilities and internal state.

21|7606975|Conference Paper|2016|Munan Li|Formal describing the organizations in the pervasive healthcare information system: Multi-agent system perspective|With the development of computing technology, the architecture of healthcare information systems (HIS) may evolve into an application of pervasive computing. HIS requires a more complex high-level design because of its involvement of many different organizations with individual interests and goals. Therefore, an agent-oriented architecture is preferable over other traditional models, such as object-oriented and service-oriented architectures. Through expanding the temporal logic with deontic logic, a novel formal model for agent organization in a multi-agent system is addressed. This new formal description method is more flexible and robust for describing the complex behavior of agent organization, and this, it can be applied to the pervasive HIS and improve its capability for high-level design and description. Recently, remote and pervasive healthcare information systems have become more popular with the development of cloud computing, the internet, and multi-agent systems. HIS is much more complex than many information systems. Therefore, the formal description of a pervasive HIS based on a multi-agent system appears very difficult. A novel description of an agent organization cannot solve all of the problems of designing a pervasive HIS, but it can improve its capability of high-level design over traditional agent models.

21|6640696|Conference Paper|2013|Zhongkui Li|Distributed robust consensus of heterogeneous uncertain multi-agent systems|This paper considers the distributed robust consensus problem of multi-agent systems with nominal linear dynamics but subject to different matching uncertainties. Due to the existence of nonidentical uncertainties, the multi-agent systems discussed in this paper are essentially heterogeneous. A distributed continuous static consensus protocol based on the relative state information is first designed, under which the consensus error is uniformly ultimately bounded and exponentially converges to a small adjustable residual set. A fully distributed adaptive consensus protocol is then designed, which, contrary to the static protocol, relies on neither the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix nor the upper bounds of the uncertainties. A sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed protocols is that each agent is stabilizable.

This paper aims at bridging the gap between transmission noise and sampled data for robust consensus of MASs. In detail, we have developed a theoretical framework for analyzing the robust consensus of MASs with sampled-data controllers and transmission noises. Using the delay-input and discretization approaches, we obtain two sufficient conditions on the existence of sampling periods and controller parameters for robust consensus of MASs, respectively. In particular, we deduce the estimates of the convergence speeds of consensus errors for the above two methods. Finally, numerical simulations are also given to validate our theoretical results.

In this paper, the leader-follower time-varying formation control problem for nonholonomic multi-agent systems has been considered using the bearing measurement. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) The multi-agent system is modeled by a nonholonomic model, which is more challenging than a linear model; (2) The formation pattern can be time-varying handled by two leaders, which is significant to practical application. Specifically, we design a distributed bearing-based formation control law for the multi-agent systems. Under the proposed proportional-integral (PI) control scheme, the agents can achieve the target formation defined by the inter-bearing of agents. By changing the motions of the two leaders, the target formation can be maintained and time-varying. Finally, the simulation and experiment results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

This paper studies consensus of multi-agent systems with unbalanced topology. Two consensus protocols are proposed to solve consensus problems. A novel disagreement function is presented for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. Sufficient conditions for consensus of multi-agent systems are established in both cases. An important finding is that the spanning directed tree plays a key role in addressing consensus. The jointly spanning directed tree is introduced for convergence analysis of multi-agent systems with switching topologies. Simulations are given for illustration the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols.

The multi-agent based architecture aims to achieve a generic, flexible, and portable testbed to support user observation and analysis in an efficient way, also independent of the implementation of the system application functions.
21|7467753|Conference Paper|2016|Hicham Hatimi|Face Recognition Using a Fuzzy Approach and a Multi-agent System from Video Sequences|Face recognition systems in a video sequence constitute an essential technical tool in several domains. To classify the faces in minimal time, the classic methods of classification being inadequate, fuzzy logic is considered as an effective technique for solving a classification problem. This article proposes a fuzzy approach for detection and face recognition in video sequences using a multi-agent modeling. This method contains several steps to classify the faces detected in the video. The multi-agent approach that is adopted allows minimizing the complexity of the processing and getting to the result with minimal time. The tasks of detection and classification of face are realized in two steps. In the first step, faces are detected using texture color and geometrical face. In the second step, the multi-agent system and fuzzy approach are used in the recognition process to find the degrees of membership. The results obtained using this method demonstrates performance in terms of robustness, in the variations illumination and speed.

From the theory of impulsive differential system, comparison system and stochastic differential system, some sufficient consensus conditions are derived and the relation between the system parameters and impulsive time window is analyzed extensively. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is confirmed by the numerical simulations finally.

22|7810000|Conference Paper|2016|Moamin A. Mahmoud|A prototype for context identification of scientific papers via agent-based text mining|In many circumstances, it is quite challenging for researchers to look for papers that match their interests when searched from databases. More often, papers which have been searched are perused individually to precisely identify the relevant contents. In this paper, we present a prototype to test our work-in-progress of an agent-based text mining algorithm that extracts and identifies the context of potentially relevant papers published in the WWW. The prototype involves an interface that enables a user to test the algorithm and view the results. The interface links to an abstract of a paper that the algorithm mines. We conduct tests on three abstracts of selected papers from the literature. We conduct the tests on various threshold settings that filter unnecessary data. The results show that the algorithm successfully identifies the contexts of the tested abstracts with thresholds of between 30% ‚Äì 60%.
22|7397341|Conference Paper|2015|Marx Viana|A Metamodel Approach to Developing Adaptive Normative Agents|Multi-agent systems have been introduced as a new paradigm for conceptualizing, designing and implementing software systems that are becoming increasingly complex, open, distributed, dynamic, autonomous and highly interactive. However, agent-oriented software engineering has not been widely adopted, mainly due to lack of modeling languages that are expressive and comprehensive enough to represent relevant agent-related abstractions and support the refinement of design models into code. Most modeling languages do not define how these abstractions interact at runtime, but many software applications need to adapt their behavior, react to changes in their environments dynamically, and align with some form of individual or collective normative application behavior (e.g., obligations, prohibitions). In this paper, we propose a metamodel approach to developing adaptive normative agents. We believe the proposed approach will advance the state of the art in agent systems so that software technologies for dynamic, adaptive, norm-based applications can be developed and implemented.

22|8798974|Journal Article|2019|Shengping Luo|Adaptive Double Event-Triggered Control for Linear Multi-Agent Systems With Actuator Faults|This paper considers the adaptive double event-triggered consensus control problem for linear multi-agent systems subject to multiplicative and additive actuator faults. The control updates and the communication among agents at the current time are determined by the proposed double event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), where two ETMs possess different triggering conditions and operate independently. In this case, the limited communication bandwidth is saved, and the control updates are also reduced. On the other hand, adaptive techniques are combined with event-triggered techniques to solve the fault-tolerant problem. Time-varying multiplicative and additive actuator faults are considered simultaneously, which is more general than some existing literature. The adaptive double event-triggered protocols are designed in two ways corresponding to different cases: 1) the network topology is completely known and 2) the topology is unknown. Both design methods can ensure the asymptotic consensus of multi-agent systems, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.

Based on above study, the novel neuroendocrine-immune multi-agent network (NEI-MAN) model was improved and was formalized, and the model defense mechanism was analyzed. The model exploits an original idea for the cooperative air-defense system of systems for surface warship formation, and can be used for reference to study on a theoretical model for modern naval combat simulation system.
22|1007918|Journal Article|2002|T. Nagata|A multi-agent approach to power system restoration|This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to power system restoration. The proposed system consists of a number of bus agents (BAGS) and a single facilitator agent (FAG). BAG is developed to decide a suboptimal target configuration after a fault occurrence by interacting with other BAGS based on only locally available information, while FAG is to act as a manager in the decision process. The interaction of several simple agents leads to a dynamic system, allowing efficient approximation of a solution. Simulation results have demonstrated that this method is able to reach suboptimal target configurations, which are favorably compared with those obtained by a mathematical programming approach.
22|5362499|Conference Paper|2009|Li Wang|Dynamic Transfer Control of Components of Complex Software System Based on Multi-agent|As a novel software paradigm, complex software system has been paid more attention to in recent years. For improving the distributed application of components on the Internet, dynamic transfer control of components is a question with practical significance in complex software system. A new control law based on multi-agent is presented, which can effectively make the agents (components) reach the desired target. In this model, swarm-intelligence is applied to design the control law. Through monitoring and evaluating environment by agents, the weight network between agents is adjusted, which guarantee achieving higher efficiency of components movement. The simulations are made in the end to demonstrate the results.

22|7003588|Conference Paper|2014|Wang Can|Research on a Novel Multi-agent Negotiation Model for E-Commerce Platform|This paper concentrates on the problem of designing a powerful multi-agent negotiation model for E-commerce platform. In the multi-agent negotiation model, negotiations mean interactions between multiple agents with several different targets. The multi-agent negotiation model can be represented by seven elements, and the key component of a negotiation agent contains private data, knowledge base and rule base. Furthermore, the information are communicated between the negotiation case database and users through the negotiation agent. After supplier and customer login in the E-commerce multi-agent negotiation system, each supplier or customer is allocated an agent. Particularly, the main task of the multi-agent negotiation model for E-commerce platform is to solve a multi-objective optimization problem. Finally, experiments are conducted to make performance evaluation based on a specific case. Based on the experimental results, conclusions can be drawn that the negotiation ability and flexibility of the buyer and seller agent can be promoted by our proposed algorithm.

22|6490922|Conference Paper|2010|Wei-Song Zhong|Controlled consensus of Multi-Agent Systems with different agent dynamics|The problem of consensus on Multi-Agent System of structurally different dynamical agent is investigated. Consensus of Multi-Agent System is usually defined in terms of identical accordance on the evolution of each individual agent in the network. However, for a network consisting of strictly different agents, this type of consensus should be redefined. In this case, a generalized definition of consensus can be considered, where the evolution of each agent can be related to others in terms of a map. In order to achieve consensus on a network of strictly different agents, local linear and nonlinear controllers are designed which force the network to achieve bounded consensus and exact consensus respectively. The main results of this study are illustrated by numerical simulation.
22|8676217|Journal Article|2019|Miel Sharf|Analysis and Synthesis of MIMO Multi-Agent Systems Using Network Optimization|This paper studies analysis and synthesis problems for diffusively coupled multi-agent systems. We focus on networks comprised of multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems that possess a property we term maximal equilibrium-independent cyclically monotone passivity (MEICMP), which is an extension of recent passivity results. We demonstrate that networks comprised of MEICMP systems are related to a pair of dual network optimization problems. In particular, we show that the steady-state behavior of the multi-agent system correspond to the minimizers of appropriately defined network optimization problems. This optimization perspective leads to a synthesis procedure for designing the network controllers to achieve a desired output. We provide detailed examples of networked systems satisfying these properties and demonstrate the results for a network of damped planar oscillators.
22|5383291|Conference Paper|2009|Sally M. El-Ghamrawy|Scalability and load balancing for Multiplatform Communication System architecture based on Intelligent agents|Distributed Multi-Agent Intelligent Systems technology has generated lots of excitement in recent years because of its promise as a new paradigm for conceptualizing, designing, and implementing software systems. Communication is the most important feature for meaningful interaction among agents in multi-agent systems. Communication enables agents to interact and share information to perform tasks to achieve their goals. Agent communication languages provide a standard in the protocol and language used in the agent communication, but can';t provide a standard in ontology, because ontology depends on the subject and concept of the communication This lack of standardization, which impedes communication between agents, is known as the interoperability problem. In order to obtain semantic interoperability in distributed multi-agent Systems, agents need to agree on the basis of different ontologies. In this paper we propose a communication layers to outline the communication between agents. In addition a Multiplatform Communication System (MPCS) architecture is proposed to provide a highly flexible and scalable system. In MPCS architecture, a Dynamic Ontology Mapping System for Agent Communication (DOMAC) is proposed based on different mapping approaches in order to provide help in the conversation among different agents.

22|1173118|Conference Paper|2002|H. Suguri|Assuring interoperability between heterogeneous multi-agent systems with a gateway agent|In this research, we address the problem of a lack of communications between heterogeneous multi-agent systems. For example, the KQML-based agent cannot talk to the FIPA-based agent and vice versa. We have identified three main reasons why different multi-agent systems are not interoperable, which we call architectural elements: (1) inconsistent mental state structures; (2) different syntax and semantics of the agent communication languages; and (3) incompatible message transport mechanisms. To solve this problem, we propose a gateway agent as a translator of the agent communications that assures the integration of heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We have developed a prototype of the gateway agent that can translate messages between the KQML agent and FIPA agent. Based on the results, we are studying a higher level of interoperability based on conversation protocols between agents.

Sufficient conditions are proposed based on the Lyapunov stability analyses and algebraic graph theory. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated via numerical simulations.
22|5337143|Conference Paper|2009|Maja Hadzic|Use and Modeling of Multi-agent Systems in Medicine|Multi-Agent System (MAS), and more specifically, ontology-based MAS, are increasingly being proposed and used within the medical domain. In this paper we represent an ontology-based multi-agent system specifically designed to intelligently retrieve information about human diseases. The human disease ontology is organized according to the four dimensions: disease types, symptoms, causes and treatments. The multi-agent system consists of four different types of agent: Interface, Manger, Information and Smart agent. We use of UML 2.1 to model social and goal-driven nature of agents. We believe that UML 2.1 has not only provided a way for standardized notation of MAS, but also for effective representation of the dynamic processes associated with these MAS.

22|8540549|Conference Paper|2018|Mohammed Ahmed Jubair|A Survey of Multi-agent Systems and Case-Based Reasoning Integration|A Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is defined as an Artificial Intelligent technique that has a problem-solving ability by reasoning previously experienced cases to solve new cases. The CBR is considered as one of the successful techniques that are applied in a widespread of problem-solving tasks and domains. However, the CBR in unknown or poorly archived cases suffers from uncertainty and imprecision. Additionally, the CBR is inefficient in performing partial reasoning and revision to distributed and dynamic problems. These problems entail flexible problem-solving and management architecture. The researchers integrate Multi-agent-systems (MAS) within the CBR to increase the ability of the CBR to solve problems that require agents'; abilities such as interaction, autonomy, and flexibility. Consequently, in this paper, we have surveyed various techniques and methods that integrate MAS in CBR (CBR-MAS) to solve different challenges in different domains. The paper outcomes two main approaches of CBR-MAS: a number of agents are integrated on the reasoning steps of the CBR cycle or a CBR or CBRs is integrated on the run cycle of an individual agent or a MAS.

In order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed multi-agent system, it has been applied to a model bulk power system. The simulation results show that the proposed multi-agent approach is effective and promising.

The collision avoidance is realized through a repelling force between agents moderated by an alignment measure. The distributed estimation algorithm estimates certain global feature indicator of the multi-agent systems through consensus of agents'; local estimations. The agents exchange information about their local estimations at discrete time instants, which are controlled by an event-triggered mechanism. The algorithm';s effectiveness is illustrated through the example of centroid estimation, and simulations show that all agents'; local estimations converge to the true position of the group centroid.
23|7045192|Conference Paper|2014|Osama Treef Alshaki|A conceptual framework for agent spawning|Multi-agent systems are subject to performance bottlenecks in cases where agents cannot perform tasks by themselves due to agent overload, insufficient resources or network constraints. Solutions to such problems include distributing tasks to other agents or migrating to remote hosts. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for agent spawning, an alternative approach to the problem of local agent overloads. Agent spawning subsumes task transfer and agent mobility. Our paradigm entails that agents may spawn, pass tasks to others, merge or die. Spawning results in better software performance in terms of processing time, enhances efficiency of network utilization and reduce communication and computation loads.

Therefore agents are required to form a team to fulfill the task requirements. In this paper an agent model is introduced that facilitates cooperation among agents. A multi-threaded multi-agent simulation framework is designed to test the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the model is significantly useful in achieving cooperation under various environmental constraints. It also allows agents to adjust their teammate selection strategies according to environmental constraints.

In this paper, a method in the form of a multi-agent system (MAS) based model for designing CSCWD systems and C/sup 2/D/sup 2/ agent concepts is proposed. The architectural properties of this type of CSCWD system are studied. We show the importance of constructing C/sup 2/D/sup 2/ agents and explore an architectural model for multi-agent-based CSCWD systems. We illustrate the structure of C/sup 2/D/sup 2/ agents, especially autonomous interface agents, and discuss some design principles for such agents. In the CSCWD system, autonomous interface agents can expediently support synchronous applications.

Experiential objective trust allows agents to make decisions about how to select other agents when a choice has to be made.

We summarise experimental results obtained from a simulated trading environment.
23|8399562|Journal Article|2019|Zhen Li|Formation Control with Mismatched Orientation in Multi-Agent Systems|In formation control problems, the orientation information of an autonomous agent may suffer from measurement errors among sensors, e.g., gyroscopes drifts, calibrate data errors and communication link failures. These measurement errors may lead to some changes of the positions of agents such that the specified formation of all agents cannot be achieved. This paper investigates the formation control problem of multi-agent systems, where each agent has orientation measurement errors when moving forward in a three-dimensional space. Such orientation measurement errors can be considered as rotation behaviors of agents, and we call this phenomenon mismatched orientation. To analyze the formation control problem with mismatched orientation, the position and velocity information of multi-agent systems is tackled by utilizing the Hajnal inequality and several mathematical techniques. The derived results reveal that the actual final formation of multi-agent systems is distorted from the desired position and can asymptotically approach to some local spheres. Based on the derived results, a distributed compensation control strategy is then applied to dealing with the formation control problem under mismatched orientation to achieve the specified shape. Subsequently, an example validates the effectiveness of our results.

In this study, the dynamical behavior of the leader system can be tracked perfectly by the states of each multi-agent robot manipulator system with 2 or 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) through the controller with the similar characters of its own structure, the similar elements such as matrices or vectors that are used to design a distributed feedback control with coupling weights adaptive laws and neural network weights online, in which these relative similar information of the follower agents and leader system can be calculated by the proposed algorithm according to the characters of each agent robot manipulator and the reference leader system. This method extends the existing works with identical multi-agent systems and leader system to nonidentical multi-agent systems with different dimensions contrast to other results in many literatures. Finally, the good stabilization performances are demonstrated to multi-agent robot manipulator system.

Such a system is used to represent the environment as well as the beliefs of the agents. We give the syntax of the programming language and develop an operational semantics in terms of a transition system.

Currently, there are several agent oriented methodologies that support the multi-agent systems development. However none are specific to the domain of medical and health education. Agent-oriented development of medical educational games must have special features such working with a multidisciplinary team, have a high degree of user involvement and allow a mutuality of game requirements. Within this context, this paper presents the development of MEDEDUC, an educational systems technology applying agile development through the AGILE-PASSI methodology. This game, which has five levels of difficulty, allows the student to study pulmonology answering questions that explore multimedia presentations. The results of this study stressed the advantages of the agile development methodology game that combines medical theory and multi-agent.

We supposed the multi-agent can only exchange information only accord to a directed communication graph. By using the relative state consensus algorithm, a sufficient condition is provided for consensus achievement. Then, a new consensus protocol which using a state observer is provided. The N observer and the N multi-agents can be viewed as 2N multi-agent components which will reach consensus asymptotically. This technique simplified consensus protocol design to some extent.

Xie|Cooperative Behavior Acquisition for Multi-agent Systems by Q-learning|In this paper, we focused on the problem of &#034;trash collection&#034;, in which multiple agents collect all trash as quickly as possible. The goal of the present research is for multiple agents to learn to accomplish a task by interacting with the environment and acquiring cooperative behavior rules. We construct the learning agent using Q-learning, which is a representative technique of reinforcement learning. Q-learning is designed to find a policy that maximizes the learning for all states. The decision policy is represented by a function. The goal is for multiple agents to learn to accomplish a task by interacting with the environment and other agents. The action value function is shared among agents. The effectiveness of the learning is verified experimentally
23|6060507|Conference Paper|2011|Deng Zhang|A robust intelligent face recognition framework using GNP-based multi-agent system|Previously, a principal component analysis (PCA) based face recognition framework using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) and Fuzzy Data Mining (GNP-PCA) was proposed to improve both the accuracy and robustness of the conventional PCA-based face recognition algorithm in the complicated illumination database. However, it is still not robust enough in the noisy testing environments. Therefore, a GNP-based multi-agent system is constructed by GNP-PCA and multi-resolution analysis in this paper. In the proposed approach, the different scales of images in the training set are regarded as different environments and each GNP-PCA is performed as an agent in each environment. Recognition is eventually realized by evaluating the prediction scores for different classes. According to the experimental results, the proposed method has almost no accuracy loss in the Gaussian noisy testing environments compared with GNP-PCA.

In this paper, a multi-agent system, MAPE (Multi-agent Processing Environment), is described, and the belief state model for an autonomous agent in the MAPE is presented. Our main focus is on the agent';s structure, agent';s belief and the connection between communication among agents and the changes of their belief states in the multi-agent societies where knowledge communication plays a key role among agents. We also propose some domain independent defaults for cooperating problem-solving in the communication situation by passing messages.

Mostafa|An autonomy viability assessment matrix for agent-based autonomous systems|In autonomous systems research, it is unlikely to find two or more autonomy models that have significant match, especially when they represent different domains. Consequently, different concepts and approaches are utilized to construct the autonomy models. These two issues among others pose the difficulty of creating a general matrix or methodology to assess a broad class of autonomy models. In this paper, we propose a novel method to assess and evaluate the viability of agent-based autonomous systems'; models. We use an Autonomy Viability Assessment Matrix (AVAM) that consists of three attributes and eleven criteria in the autonomy viability assessment. We apply the matrix on seven autonomy models. We present the assessment result of the AVAM which confirms its ability to assess a broad class of autonomy models.

Nandhini|Implementation of class timetabling using multi agents|Timetabling problem means assigning activities to time slots such that various constraints and restrictions are satisfied. In artificial intelligence domain, the techniques viz., graph coloring, hill climbing , tabu search, simulated annealing , variable neighborhood search etc., have been used in which searching is made faster by applying heuristics . In this paper, implementation of class timetabling with multi agents by steepest ascent hill climbing algorithm has been proposed. It uses agents namely, combination generator which generates the maximum possible combinations for the inputting timetable and minfinder which finds a combination with minimum evaluation function value for further successive examination . A improved heuristics is applied while generating timetables from random initial solution to the optimal solution to reach the goal at the earliest. Also, the architecture, operations and the interactions between multi agents while implementing class timetabling have been discussed.

By introducing a position error and an appropriate artificial potential function, the formation control problem of the multi-agent system with fully unknown dynamics is solved. The agents should keep a desired distance from a time-varying reference as their virtual leader. The adaptive fuzzy controller for each agent includes terms of artificial potential function and H

23|6560902|Conference Paper|2013|Yini Lv|Decentralized filtering a multi-agent system with local parametric couplings based on Kalman filter|In this paper, decentralized filtering of multiagent systems with coupling uncertainties is proposed and investigated. The considered multi-agent system is composed of many agents, each of which evolves with a discrete-time stochastic linear time-varying dynamics, and every agent can be locally influenced by its neighbor agents. Therefore the states evolution of each agent is not only related with its previous states but also related with its neighbors'; previous states in the linear dynamic system. Communication limitations existing in the considered multi-agent system restrict that each agent can only observe its own measurements (outputs) and its neighbor agents'; outputs while the states are invisible to any agent. Because of communication limitations and information constraints, without knowing the coupling gains of the local interactions, it is not easy for each agent to estimate its states by traditional kalman filter or other state observers, which were extensively discussed in the literature. In this preliminary study, for the considered coupled linear discrete-time multiagent system with uncertain linear local couplings, based on the key idea of state augmentation and the certainty-equivalence principle borrowed from the area of adaptive control, we propose an efficient decentralized kalman filtering scheme, for each agent, to simultaneously estimate the unknown states and coupling parameters, and extensive simulations are conducted, which have clearly verified the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized filtering scheme.
23|8618737|Conference Paper|2018|Issam Matazi|Multi-Agent System Based on Fuzzy Logic for E-Learning Collaborative System|Collaborative learning is an active process by which the learner works to build his knowledge. The tutor plays there the role of facilitator of learning while the group participates as a source of information, as a motivational agent. A rapid bibliographic synthesis shows that the evaluation of the quality of collaboration in a group is based on the analysis of the interaction traces left by the stakeholders on the LMS. The analysis of these traces allows tutors to intervene to support and motivate the learners and thus minimize the risk of abandonment. However, because of the significant volumes of traces left by the learners, we found it urgent to develop an automatic system of assistance for tutors concerning monitoring learners to improve their level of involvement in the collaborative process. The system (SISAC) that we have proposed in the context of this research is an intelligent MAS based on the fuzzy logic technique for assessing the level of learner collaboration. Fuzzy system inputs are indicators derived from the analysis of learner traces on online collaborative learning platforms (LMS). For the validation of the system, we conducted experiments with the learners of the ENSA in Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra. These tests allowed us to measure the positive impact of the system on improving the collaborative behavior of learners.
23|8204281|Conference Paper|2017|Aigerim Altayeva|Development of multi-agent systems with distributed solutions for energy problems|In modern conditions, the functioning and management of electric power systems requires the creation of a computational model for large-scale schemes based on methods for estimating the state. Such schemes are not fully observable, data may be distorted, their synchronization is poor and, as a consequence, the adoption of incorrect decisions based on the calculation model. At present, the agent approach is not applied to the development of systems aimed at solving problems in the field of electric power industry and assessing the states of electric power systems in particular. The proposed approach to the development of multi-agent systems should enable the interaction of agents created on different software platforms, create new ones and edit existing algorithms in the system through agent scenarios. An approach to creating multi-agent systems for estimating the states of electric power systems with the possibility of cross-platform interactions and agent scenarios is developed. The proposed approach was tested on a test system, and at the moment a system is being developed for assessing the state of electric power systems.
23|699242|Conference Paper|1998|J. Denzinger|Enhancing conventional search systems with multi-agent techniques: a case study|Our TECHS concept (TEams for Cooperative Heterogeneous Search) is aimed at the cooperation of different search systems. Therefore, a search agent is a sequential search system with a fixed setting of its parameters. In a team of agents, several agents might use the same search system but then they must employ different parameters. In contrast to most other approaches the problem to solve is not partitioned into subproblems that are then given to the search agents. Instead, all agents obtain the whole problem. Exceptions are only made for agents that cannot &#034;understand&#034; the whole problem. They only get the parts they can work on. Thus, we can use existing sequential search systems in our teams. The data interchange between search agents in TECHS is both demand driven and success driven. Demand driven cooperation is characterized by agents computing patterns of data that would help them fulfil their search task and send these patterns as requests to other agents. The other agents then send all their data matching the patterns (that may be the result of additional computations triggered by the request) back to the requesting agent. Note that in search systems it is rather difficult to find criteria that can determine which data an agent needs to advance or finish a search task. The general idea of success driven data interchange is that an agent determines the data that was, so far, very useful for its search and periodically shares this data with its colleagues.

Through bringing in the theory of Multi-Agent, this text has proposed a kind of new-type long-range monitoring system of water-supply based on multi-agent. The system consists of control center agent, monitoring agent federation, as well as inquiring-pay agent. Monitoring agent federation completes the function such as measuring and treatment of the full parameters of all the monitoring points in the entire water-supply system, and is responsible for sending measured data to the control center; after analyses and processes the received messages, control center agent sends the handled data to monitoring agent to go on the new regulation running on the one hand, on the other hand to inquiring-pay agent for users to inquire and pay. This system, which has many advantages such as communication swift and coordination convenient, is of greater practical value to the monitoring field of water-supply in which monitoring points are dispersed, the amount of data transmission is larger, and nobody is on duty.

24|7858953|Conference Paper|2016|R. K. Pandey|Multi agent system driven SSSC for ATC enhancement|This paper presents the performance evaluation of Multi Agent System (MAS) driven SSSC. The concept of ATC enhancement has been proposed with SSSC employing MAS which quickly re-establishes power flow over the existing transmission line with almost real time power control mode. Multi Agent System (MAS) works on soft signalling based distributed technology which is capable of solving complex problems by adding intellectual attributes. Interconnected transmission system line loading has to be maintained within the design limits irrespective of external conditions like heavy loading, and this is possible only if the excess load is shifted from one line to another. The redistribution of loading can be obtained by proper coordination among multiple controllers using agents which monitor, communicate and govern the control of power flow controllers (SSSC) to obtain desired loading under dynamic conditions. This operational mode enhances existing ATC values of other lines in the network. Power flow controllers when used in combination with MAS can be viewed as smart controller. The system has been simulated by modeling the system in Matlab Simulink. The multi-agent system is implemented by using an open source agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Both Matlab simulation and multi-agent system are connected together via MACSimJX toolbox.

24|926996|Conference Paper|2000|P. Charlton|Evaluating the FIPA standards and their role in achieving cooperation in multi-agent systems|Focuses on the analysis and evaluation of certain aspects of the current specification standards provided by FIPA (Foundation of Intelligent Physical Agents). The work reported in this paper is based on the development of a multi-agent application-an audio-visual entertainment broadcasting (AVEB) system. This has resulted in determining the advantages and limitations of using the FIPA standards to build complex multi-agent systems (MASs). The development and testing of the AVEB application are part of an EU project called FACTS (FIPA Agent Communication Technologies and Services, ACTS Project No. AC317). A main result of using FIPA has been the identification of the usefulness and power of its protocols. The reason for the importance of the protocols in developing MASs is that it provides a degree of expressing cooperation within the MAS architecture. As the protocols stand currently, they are not sufficient to capture a complete explicit model of the cooperative requirements in MASs. However, they do provide a basis from which to start. We examine this feature of FIPA further, in order to evaluate its role as a bridge between the mental agency and social agency requirements in the development of cooperation in MASs.

This paper evaluates the Multi-Agent System performance by evaluating each agent performance and then gets the overall Multi-Agent System performance. The implemented performance criteria are the intelligence, security and scalability criterion. We measure these criteria using the Goal/Question/Metric model, average function and Fuzzy Logic. Then, we generate the performance percentage using Fuzzy Logic system. Finally, we apply the suggested model on a sample of a Multi-Agent System (Code Advisory System), and analyse the result. The results are percentages of each criterion and the performance. In addition, we check the suggested model sensitivity if some entities of the model criteria are neglected.

For the case where the graph topology is directed and the leaders set is the neighbor of only a small portion of followers, distributed tracking controllers are designed to ensure that all the states of the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability. Also, it can be proved that the followers'; outputs will exponentially converge to the convex hull spanned by the dynamic leaders'; outputs with tunable tracking errors. The efficiency of the tracking controllers is demonstrated by a simulation example.

It has been assumed that the agents are homogeneous having uncertain dynamics. A hierarchical cooperative control has been proposed as a solution to the problem. In the first layer, information about wind and concentration has been utilized using a measurement model and swarm intelligence to predict the probable location of source. Trajectory mapping has been done in the second layer, followed by distributed cooperative control in the third layer. The control layer attempts to drive the agents into consensus to locate the odor source, wherein a sliding mode controller has been designed owing to its inherent robustness and powerful disturbance rejection capabilities. Numerical simulations have been presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.

In spite of this promise and many showcases and prototypes, multi-agent systems are not widely applied in industry nowadays. Reasons for this are for example lacking trust in the technology and special demand for safety and security in these domains. To address these topics, the Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model is applied on heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Additionally interoperability rules are introduced for enhancing the interoperability of MAS. It is further outlined how such rules can be used for unit testing single agents and for runtime verification.

Efficient building energy control can considerably reduce energy costs. A smart grid takes advantage of bi-directional energy and information flow between the utility grid and the energy user. Smart buildings can charge or discharge energy or power from multiple buildings (multi-agent systems) using smart meters via battery storage in the smart buildings. However, there is very little research on how to share energy among multi-agent systems and optimal power flow among smart buildings (multi-agent systems) in the smart grid. In this paper, the authors use an advanced optimization method to present optimal power flow and energy-sharing among smart buildings. With this research, it is expected that this method can improve the smart grid optimal power flow and energy-sharing stability among smart buildings, and enhance energy dissipation balance to reach stability among many smart buildings in the smart grid.

Multi-agent system (MAS) is an important research field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) and it proposes a new way of combat simulation. The focus of this paper is the MAS theory and its application in combat simulation. Definition of agent and MAS was proposed firstly and then the differences between MAS based and conventional combat simulation methods ware analyzed. After a discussion over the characteristics of combat, we found the combat was a complex adaptive system (CAS). MAS based CAS should be a new way of combat simulation. Finally, as an example, ISAAC, a famous MAS based combat simulation system, was analyzed to show the application of MAS in combat simulation. The analysis shows that MAS has many characteristics of modern warfare and is a promising way of combat simulation.

For the case of undirected communication topology, both sufficient and necessary conditions are presented for mean square consensus of discrete-time LTI multi-agent systems over analog fading networks. It is further shown that in the case of single output, the sufficient condition is also necessary, while for other cases, the gap between the sufficient condition and the necessary condition may be unavoidable. Besides, sufficient and necessary conditions are also provided for the mean square consensus over a balanced directed communication topology by using Lyapunov methods. All the derived criteria demonstrate intricately how system dynamics, communication quality and network topological structure interplay with each other to allow the existence of a linear distributed consensus controller.

T-S fuzzy models are presented to describe leader-followers multi-agent systems(MASs) with imprecise communication topology structure, and a fuzzy distributed adaptive control protocol is proposed. With the dynamic of leader unknown to any of the agent, the proposed protocol guarantees that the follower agents can track the leader.

Finally, simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in this sudy.

Each agent is assigned a local STL task regardless of the tasks that the other agents are assigned to. Such a task may be dependent, i.e., the satisfaction of the task may depend on the behavior of more than one agent, so that the satisfaction of the conjunction of all local tasks may be conflicting. We propose a hybrid feedback control strategy using time-varying control barrier functions. Our control strategy finds least violating solutions in the aforementioned conflicting situations based on a suitable robustness notion and by initiating collaboration among agents.
24|4654898|Conference Paper|2008|Takamasa Iio|Evolutionary adaptive behavior in noisy multi-agent system|In this paper, we discuss a relationship between perceptual noise and fitness of agents in a multi-agent system. In multi-agent system, agents perceive environmental information and act based on this information. Therefore, in case that the perceptual information contains some noise, a cooperative behavior of agents is more challenging and the resulting fitness of the agents is inferior. In order to develop a behavior of the agents that is robust to the perception noise, we evolved the behavior of the agents in noisy environment. As a result, the evolved behavior, obtained in a noisy environment is superior (in terms of robustness) than that evolved in noiseless environment.

The multi agent manufacturing system consist three types of agents: product agent, order agent, and resource agent. At the beginning of each production period, order agent negotiates with resource agents to determine feasibility of order and acquire resource for order processing. The negotiation model is bilateral and the objective of negotiation process is to enhance order response speed of the manufacturing system and minimize system tardiness loss through dynamic resource allocation. The presented negotiation mechanism incorporates value based bids evaluating and preemption scheme, and negotiation process is limited by time. More cases are considered for preemption to make system more flexible.

First, a network-based consensus protocol with input saturation constraints is introduced to accommodate some network-induced effects such as delay, data quantization and time-varying sampling interval. Next, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method is utilized to show the exponential convergence of the leader-following error system to a bounded set region under a delay-dependent stability condition, together with estimation of the region of initial conditions. Then with leveraging this stability condition, the gain matrix of the network-based consensus controller is designed for linear multi-agent systems.
25|8942297|Conference Paper|2019|Sidi Mohamed Snineh|Towards a multi-agents model for errors detection and correction in big data flows|The quality of data for decision-making will always be a major factor for companies that want to remain competitors. In addition, the era of Big Data has brought new challenges for the processing, management, storage of data and in particular the challenge represented by the veracity of these data which is one of the 5Vs that characterizes Big Data. This characteristic that defines the quality or reliability of the data and its sources must be verified in the future systems of each company. In this paper, we present an approach that helps to improve the quality of Big Data by the distributed execution of algorithms for detecting and correcting data errors. The idea is to have a multi-agents model for errors detection and correction in big data flow. This model linked to a repository specific to each company. This repository contains the most frequent errors, metadata, error types, error detection algorithms and error correction algorithms. Each agent of this model represents an algorithm and will be deployed in multiple instances when needed. The use of these agents will go through two steps. In the first step, the detection agents and error correction agents manage each flow entering the system in real time. In the second step, all the processed data flows in first step will be a dataset to which the error detection and correction agents are applied in batch in order to process other types of errors. Among architectures who allow this processing type, we have chosen Lambda architecture.

We introduce the expressivity to infected agents, which is the probability that infected agents announce their infective states to other agents in the system. We study the effects of expressivity of infected agents on epidemic spreading, andpropose a control strategy that each moving susceptible agent avoids the infected agents. The numerical simulation shows that the strategy can improve the epidemic threshold, which is therefore valid for epidemic control.

25|6925838|Conference Paper|2014|Takeshi Nagata|A decentralized distribution power system restoration by using multi-agent Approach|This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to decentralized distribution power system restoration. So far, numerous studies have been conducted on power system restoration problems. From the view point of the system structures, these researches can be divided into two categories: centralized systems and decentralized systems. In this study, we have solved the distribution power system restoration problem by using multi-agent approach, which is categorized in the distributed approach. The solved solutions have been compared with the solutions which were solved by the mathematical programming approach. From the simulation results, it can be seen the proposed restoration method could reach the right solution by making use of only local information. The solution quality is equivalent to the quality of the centralized system. This means that the proposed multi-agent restoration system is a promising approach to more large-scale distribution network.
25|886562|Conference Paper|2000|S. Taniguchi|Control of intelligent agent systems (robots) using extended soft computing|Recently, researches on group robot systems (multi-agent intelligent robots: MAIR) have been reported, where a number of robots behave in a group like birds or ants. It is generally known that each robot has a limited intellectual power, but the robots can behave more intellectually in a group because they can interact each other. It has been reported that the multi-agent robot systems which can do many kinds of tasks efficiently by training the rules between environments and actions using reinforcement learning. Intelligent agent systems are also applied to decision making, human interface, perception and others even in a robot system (intelligent function agent robot: IFAR). This paper first introduces extended soft computing (ESC) which is the fusion/combination of fuzzy, neuro, genetic and chaotic computings and immune network theory in order to explain, what they call, complex systems and cognitive and reactive AIs. Then, contemporary intelligent system concept is discussed while the ESC is promising to realize it. Finally, a decision making robot with multi-agents (antigens and antibodies of immune networks), fuzzy inference and reinforcement learning (genetic computing) is described, as an example. It is confirmed that the ESC plays an important role in constructing intelligent robots.

Instead of only monitoring of total power load, this system can measure power consumption of each type load consisted in total power load. Since the non-intrusive power load decomposition system has a multilevel and distributed structure, the multi-agent technology is used in the monitoring system. The system framework is established and the detailed functions of each agent are described. The hardware configuration of this system is presented in the paper, and the monitoring softer ware is developed at a LabVIEW platform. The experimental results indicate that the load decomposition system can decompose power load effectively.
25|7379122|Conference Paper|2015|Shahrinaz Ismail|Deploying the concept of agent-mediated knowledge management in mobile apps for collective decision making|Social media users have shifted their communication medium to mobile apps, especially when important decisions need to be made at anytime, anywhere. Often at times, virtual groups are created over mobile apps to brainstorm on solutions to the problems and decide on a right solution. The process of making decisions over the mobile apps group could be analysed by identifying the pattern of group interaction. Among the decision-making techniques identified for analysis are the consult and consensus, which could further contribute in identifying the leadership type, observing member and non-observing member that exist in a virtual group. This paper proposes a deployment of personal knowledge management processes on the mobile apps group interaction, for a case of decision-making process. The outcome includes an agent-mediated knowledge management model that introduces Monitoring Agents, with roles to get, understand and share knowledge on interaction patterns, and further identify the leadership type, observing member and non-observing member. Future work is seen as beneficial to agent-mediated decision support system, in which the Monitoring Agents could assist in simulating the right decision-making technique to use for solving different kinds of problems.

Each methodology is applicable for a selected group of projects. These methodologies include Prometheus, MaSE, Tropos, Gaia and many more. Each comes with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, the authors are trying to provide an extension to the Gaia methodology which is outstanding in early requirements analysis and design. The only limitation comes when we need to share goals between agents. The goals are also not identified which poses problems in mapping them to Roles and Agents. As an extension to Gaia, the authors have modified the model of Gaia by introducing Goal Model by deriving goals from the organization and sub-organization and fitting them before mapping them onto the roles. The authors have taken the ‚ÄúLegal Semantic Web‚Äù as a case study.

Itabashi|A Support System for Home Care Service Based on Multi-agent System|According to the increase of high quality welfare services in Japan, welfare services need engineering supports. In this paper, we develop a support system for a home care service, using a multi-agent system. The decision of a care schedule is performed autonomously by the negotiations among agents so that it is sufficient for clients and helpers to confirm schedules settled by the agents. They can confirm the schedules using PDAs, which can be easily handled even by elders. Consequently, it is expected that our support system reduces the total cost of a home care service.

25|6227952|Conference Paper|2012|Nguyen-Thinh Le|Communication-free detection of resource conflicts in multi-agent-based cyber-physical systems|Multi-agent approaches can be applied to model behaviour and relations of entities in cyber-physical systems. Here entities frequently compete on insufficient resources (e.g., hardware) at the same time. Hence, resource conflicts between several agents are one of the most important conflict types in such multi-agent systems. These conflicts can significantly slow the operation of a system down, or in the worst case, might lead to a system halt. In this paper, we investigate the challenge of efficiently detecting resource conflicts. For this purpose, we introduce a conflict detection model based on beliefs of BDI agents. One benefit of our approach is that conflicts are detected using local belief state information of agents without communication. For evaluation purposes we apply our conflict detection model to a multi-agent system representing a transportation service with moving robots on a fictitious airport to measure the rate of collisions and completed transportation tasks. The evaluation study showed that the system deploying the conflict detection model can avoid collisions between moving agents and agents execute tasks successfully.

This paper proposed a optimal logical ring architecture of multiple middle agents in multi-agent systems, according to probability theory, the system are simplified by reducing the numbers of middle agents under the condition of the system is not broken down with definite probability. The optimization results show that the stability and flexibility of the system don';t decrease although reducing the number of middle agents, moreover, middle agents can accomplish more tasks in the logical ring. Analysis results show that the presented method is effective and feasible.
25|4407256|Conference Paper|2007|Han Yu|Intelligent Software Agent Design Tool Using Goal Net Methodology|Intelligent agent is a fast emerging technology and has wide range of applications. Although there are several tools for agent development, there is few design tool to assist the conversion from paper based agent mental state design to effective representation of them in abstract data structures which can be used by the agent management system to create intelligent software agents. This paper proposes the goal net designer which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for modeling agent behavior based on goal net model, a goal orient methodology. It provides a way for the users to simplify the various stages of the design process and automatically generate design data which can be used by the multi- agent development environment (MADE) to automatically create intelligent agents. The system reduces the level of skills required for developing agent augmented application to such an extent that users with little knowledge in intelligent software agent technology can easily add intelligent agents into their applications and save time and cost involved in the development process.

The systems are assumed to be heterogeneous, that is, the dynamics of agents can be different each other. Then, the problem is to find the optimal additional paths with which the convergence rates of the systems are improved to be fastest. We propose to approximate the dynamics of each agent by motif subsystems and then find the optimal additional path for the convergence rate. We also demonstrate numerical simulations for showing the effectiveness of our proposing method.
25|8665861|Journal Article|2019|Lyulong He|Time-Varying Formation Control for Second-Order Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems With Directed Topology and Communication Delay|Time-varying formation control protocol design and analysis problems for the second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems with directed interaction topology and communication delay are investigated. A local information-based distributed protocol is designed by utilizing the delayed state information of neighbors. Through system decomposition and stability analysis, an explicit description of the feasible time-varying formation set is given. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the systems with the directed topology and communication delay to achieve time-varying formation are obtained, which are related to the topology of the interaction graph and the feasibility of the predefined formation. Necessary constraints on the gain parameters and the sampling period are proposed, so as to guide the design of parameters in the protocol. The numerical simulation results indicate that the protocol can steer the agents to accomplish the desired time-varying formation and effectively tolerate the relatively large bounded communication delay. Outdoor experiment with quadrotors is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results with one sampling period delay.

25|6040658|Conference Paper|2011|Souhila Arib|A Plan Based Coalition Formation Model for Multi-agent Systems|This article addresses the coalition formation problem in a multi-agent context where agents plan their activities dynamically and use these plans to coordinate their actions and form suitable coalitions. In most coalition formation methods, when negotiating their coalitions the agents focus mainly on the immediate tasks to be executed, in order to decide which coalitions to form. Agents relegate the negotiations of the coalitions for their subsequent tasks to later stages of the coordination process. This paper deals with this issue and proposes a new coalition formation model which is based on two principles:(1) it uses the plans of the agents to guide the search for the coalitions to be formed and shows the significance of not only taking into account the immediate actions of the agents in the coalition formation process, (2) it analyzes the coalition proposals already suggested by other agents in order to derive their intentions and thus facilitate the negotiations fort he coalitions. First we analyse and develop the constraints that should be enforced on self-interested agents, in order to form suitable coalitions which guarantee significant solution concepts. Then we detail our coalition formation mechanism.
25|6911256|Conference Paper|2014|Essaid El Haji|Expert system design for educational and vocational guidance, using a multi-agent system|This paper presents the design of a multi-expert system to help in educational and vocational guidance by using a multi-agent approach. This approach, which is at the connection of several areas, especially artificial intelligence, seeks to distribute a problem on a set of entities called agents that communicate with each other to coordinate their behavior and cooperate to solve a problem. The problem to be dealt with in this article is that of educational and career guidance where different types of knowledge come from four sources: pedagogical expert, psychological expert, sociological expert and economic expert. In addition to the four mentioned experts, other two experts are added which are a coaching expert and the system supervisor. The latter, that organizes tasks between agents, is considered as expert in the sense that he has its own database of rules. Such a system is a tool for decision support that allows students and job seekers to build their professional projects while taking into account the various factors involved in the process of educational and vocational guidance.
25|6676791|Journal Article|2014|Arangamanikkannan Manickam|A Novel Self-Evolving Intelligent Multiagent Framework for Power System Control and Protection|In this paper, we propose a multiagent methodology (MAM) for power system monitoring and protection. The uniqueness of the proposed architecture is the ability of MAM to evolve in the wake of an attack of malicious intent by mutation, thus always monitoring power system buses remotely. The architecture interacts with the mutated agents using a voting methodology, thus alleviating the effect of agent malfunction in the presence of an attack. In addition, this proposed architecture enables inter-agent communication, thus developing a collaborative framework and increasing the degree of fault tolerance. This method is tested on a two-area five-machine eight-bus power network for abnormal condition detection and generator bus isolation, as well as for restoring power to the area that is affected by the bus isolation. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed methodology is not only capable of detecting the power grid attack but also capable of continuously monitoring and isolating the generator bus even in the presence of sustained attack as the agents are regenerated.
26|7978794|Conference Paper|2017|Anna Wang|Research on synchronization control method of networked multi-agent system of multiple manipulator-motors|For coordination and cooperation among the four motors in the same position of four manipulators, in order to make the manipulator motors have the precision and same speed, the double-layer control strategy is adopted in this paper. In the lower control, only the single mechanical arm motor can be stably controlled, the multiple manipulator motors can be synchronized. Therefore, fuzzy PID is used as the control compensator. And the control strategy of single motor based on fuzzy PID is designed. In the high-level control, considering the four motors system in the same position of four manipulators needs to meet the requirements of rapidity in the reality. Based on the prediction mechanism, a multi-motor synchronous consistency control strategy based on network multi-agent prediction mechanism is proposed. To ensure that multiple manipulator system can quickly achieve the same synchronization. Respectively, simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed control strategy as described above.
26|6859091|Conference Paper|2014|Shize Su|Distributed synchronization control of multi-agent systems with unknown nonlinearities: The case of fixed directed communication topology|This paper revisits the distributed adaptive control problem for synchronization of multi-agent systems where the dynamics of the agents are nonlinear, nonidentical, unknown and subject to external disturbances. The communication topology under consideration is represented by a fixed strongly-connected directed graph. Distributed neural networks are used to approximate the uncertain dynamics and decentralized control protocols using local neighborhood information are proposed to solve the cooperative tracker problem, the problem of synchronization of all follower agents to a leader agent. In particular, we show that, under the proposed decentralized control protocols, the synchronization errors are ultimately bounded and their ultimate bounds can be reduced arbitrarily by choosing the control parameter appropriately.

Finally, the validity of the results is shown by computer simulation.
26|7161708|Conference Paper|2015|Xiongjun Wu|Saturated output-based event-triggered control for consensus of multi-agent systems|A saturation allowed output-based event-triggered control for consensus of multi-agent systems (MAS for short) design method is proposed in this paper for the linear systems subject to input saturation. We introduced the saturation allowed controller design method into the multi-agent schemes, in which an event-triggered mechanism are designed. The multi-agent controllers are not activated until the response of the system exceeds some pre-defined event-triggered limitation, rather than periodically sampling as feedback. Also, the output feedback scheme is introduced into the event-triggered MAS mechanism. In this case, the output feedback of the plant is activated when it really need to, and then the saturation allowed method is then employed to deal with the saturation nonlinearity. In this proposed scheme, since the saturation is allowed and no hard constraint is needed to imposed on the controller input, we can makes fuller utilization of the available actuator capacity. The proposed saturated output-based event-triggered control scheme provides the system stability and guaranteed event-triggered condition for consensus of multi-agent systems. Also, results are provided for minimizing the frequency of the event-triggered actions.
26|7954660|Journal Article|2017|Akinori Sakaguchi|Dynamic Pinning Consensus Control of Multi-Agent Systems|In this letter, consensus pinning control for a single agent in a multi-agent system is discussed. The consensus speed by static pinning control is bounded in general. We propose dynamic pinning control using a minimum order observer and an integrator to increase the consensus speed. Furthermore, we show that the consensus speed using dynamic pinning control increases up to the absolute value of the largest real part of all canceled pole-zero pairs of the reducible transfer function. We show that dynamic pinning control achieves faster consensus than static pinning control if a network structure is a complete k-partite graph. It is shown, however, that an overshoot occurs at a pinning agent and increases as the consensus speed increases.

Moraes|Improvisational multi-agent organization: using director agent to coordinate improvisational agents|Coordination is an important characteristic in the development of agents organizations, allowing agents to understand the existent relationships among agents that compose an specific organization. This paper proposes an improvisational multi-agent organization which incorporate a new model of coordination, named improvised direction. The organization is based on the ideas of improvisational theatre, and improvised direction represents the kind of coordination that an improvisational director executes over its actors. The model of coordination is developed considering an improvisational director functionality, where the director organizes a group of actors using improvisation processes related to constraint satisfaction and analogy by similarity. This kind of coordination is particularly interesting in systems that support human-computer interaction such as learning environments, entertainment and electronic commerce.
26|6640697|Conference Paper|2013|Bin Zhou|Consensus of high-order multi-agent systems with input and communication delays-output feedback case|We study in this paper the consensus problem for multi-agent systems with agents characterized by high-order linear systems with time delays in both the communication network and inputs. Provided that the open-loop dynamics of the agents is not exponentially unstable, but may be polynomially unstable, and the communication topology contains a directed spanning tree, a truncated predictor feedback approach is established to solve the consensus problem. It is shown that, if the delays are constant and exactly known, the consensus problems can be solved by observer based output feedback protocols for arbitrarily large yet bounded delays. If it is further assumed that the open-loop dynamics of the agents only contains zero eigenvalues, the delays are allowed to be time-varying and unknown.

Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in the paper.
26|7814278|Journal Article|2017|Johan Thunberg|Local Lyapunov Functions for Consensus in Switching Nonlinear Systems|This note presents two theorems on asymptotic state consensus of continuous time nonlinear multi-agent systems. The agents reside in Rm and have switching interconnection topologies. Both the first theorem, formulated in terms of the states of individual agents, and the second theorem, formulated in terms of the pairwise states for pairs of agents, can be interpreted as variants of Lyapunov';s second method. The two theorems complement each other; the second provides stronger convergence results under weaker graph topology assumptions, whereas the first often can be applied in a wider context in terms of the structure of the right-hand sides of the systems. The second theorem also sheds some new light on well-known results for consensus of nonlinear systems where the right-hand sides of the agents'; dynamics are convex combinations of directions to neighboring agents. For such systems, instead of proving consensus by using the theory of contracting convex sets, a local quadratic Lyapunov function can be used.

The traditional fault location method is no longer adaptive. This paper proposed an effective fault location method based on Multi-Agent System (MAS) and the extended impedance-based fault-location algorithm in ineffectively grounded distribution systems with DG. To short-circuit faults, this method can locate the fault-association-setion firstly by MAS and then can deduce the fault distance using measurements at the sending-end and the synchronized output current of DGs. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is accurate.

Sentiment dataset can be used to build a deep learning model to analyze opinions about a field. For testing our approach, we create a dataset of 100000 tweets and classify it using an automatic sentiment classifier. Using this dataset, we build a deep learning-based model for sentiment classifier, which is able to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments. The tests show that that the proposed model can classify sentiment perfectly better than the generic model.

26|9597491|Early Access Article|2021|Guangzheng Hu|Event-Triggered Communication Network With Limited-Bandwidth Constraint for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning|Communicating agents with each other in a distributed manner and behaving as a group are essential in multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, real-world multi-agent systems suffer from restrictions on limited bandwidth communication. If the bandwidth is fully occupied, some agents are not able to send messages promptly to others, causing decision delay and impairing cooperative effects. Recent related work has started to address the problem but still fails in maximally reducing the consumption of communication resources. In this article, we propose an event-triggered communication network (ETCNet) to enhance communication efficiency in multi-agent systems by communicating only when necessary. For different task requirements, two paradigms of the ETCNet framework, event-triggered sending network (ETSNet) and event-triggered receiving network (ETRNet), are proposed for learning efficient sending and receiving protocols, respectively. Leveraging the information theory, the limited bandwidth is translated to the penalty threshold of an event-triggered strategy, which determines whether an agent at each step participates in communication or not. Then, the design of the event-triggered strategy is formulated as a constrained Markov decision problem and reinforcement learning finds the feasible and optimal communication protocol that satisfies the limited bandwidth constraint. Experiments on typical multi-agent tasks demonstrate that ETCNet outperforms other methods in reducing bandwidth occupancy and still preserves the cooperative performance of multi-agent systems at the most.
26|9516939|Early Access Article|2021|Yi Dong|An Event-triggered Observer and Its Applications in Cooperative Control of Multi-Agent Systems|This paper proposes an event-triggered control design for cooperative control of heterogeneous multi-agent systems. The design is serial in nature and consists of the design of a distributed event-triggered observer for each follower agent that estimates the desired information of the leader system in the presence of parametric uncertainty and, based on this observer, the design of a distributed event-triggered controller. A salient feature of our observer design is that it obeys the separation principle in the sense that the event-triggered control can be designed after the observer has been designed. As a result, the observer is applicable to different follower agent dynamics and the event-triggered time sequence for the controller is asynchronous of that of the observer. We implement this design scheme on linear heterogeneous multi-agent systems and uncertain Euler-Lagrange multi-agent systems, and achieve results that significantly extend the existing ones.
26|8833300|Conference Paper|2019|Jimin Yu|Weighted Group Consensus Analysis of Multi-agent Networks with Different Time Delays|For first-order multi-agent systems with connected bipartite topology, this paper investigates the weighted group consensus problem of the systems with different time delays. By applying the frequency domain control theory, we analyze and obtain the sufficient condition such that the systems can reach weighted group consensus. The obtained conclusions show that the achievement of the systems'; group consensus relates to the weights between the agents and the input time delays of the agents, while communication time delays between the agents are irrelevant to it. However, communication time delays will affect the dynamic performance of the systems. When the communication time delays of the systems satisfy the assumption proposed in this paper, the weighted group consensus of the system can be reached. Finally, several simulations show the correctness of the obtained results.

In the switched systems, we consider two subsystems, CT (continuous-time) subsystems and DT (discrete-time) subsystems. A linear distributed control algorithm is proposed for leader-following consensus in the multi-agent systems with switched dynamics. Moreover, based on the method of modern control theory and matrix theory, some consensus conditions are derived for leader-following multi-agent systems with general second-order switched dynamics. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of the theoretical results are tested by some simulation results.

The aim of this paper is to give a mathematical foundation for the design and the analysis of multi-agent systems by means of a Petri-net-based model. The proposed model is based on place/transition nets, one of the simplest classes of Petri nets. The main difference is that each token, representing an agent, is also a place/transition net. It is sufficiently simple for the mathematical analysis, but has enough modeling power.
26|9248098|Conference Paper|2020|Yi Sun|Multi-Agent Cluster Systems Formation Control with Obstacle Avoidance|For formation control and obstacle avoidance of multi-agent cluster systems, this paper proposes a new formation control and obstacle avoidance algorithm based on artificial potential field method, the advantage of which is that it can enhance the robustness of multi-agent systems and make the overall performance as no central control. Formation control adopts the follower-leader method. Leaders are not artificially designated, but selected by autonomous decision-making of multi-agent systems. When the selected leader fails to continue to perform the task, the remaining followers can independently choose a new leader and form a new formation to continue the task according to the number of existing agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a numerical simulation. The simulation results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can perform no central formation control and obstacle avoidance for multi-agent systems.

26|7396777|Conference Paper|2015|Emna Karoui Chaabane|Distributed Government Architecture Based on Intelligent Agents and Web Services|Over the past few years, web service and multi agent approach has been used frequently in the development of E-government services. Most of the existing architectures use a middleware and hence are centralized ones. This type of solutions can increase transaction time and communication cost. Distributed models can overcome this problem. However, a major part of the existing works presents a coordination approach between Government Entities usually based on workflow systems. Thus, in order to use these approaches, it is necessary to rebuilt or modify the entails IT infrastructure of governmental organizations. This alternative is so difficult and costly especially in developing countries where Government Entities are not necessary equipped with workflow systems. This paper describes a new distributed model for e-government services based on the potential of multi-agent system. Our model is concerned with only inputs and outputs of each Government Entity system. So, the proposed solution does not require equipping each Government Entity by a Workflow. The applicability of our model is illustrated by a case study of an identity card creation in Tunisia.

27|5233306|Conference Paper|2009|Qing-song Li|Model Design of Job Shop Scheduling Based on Multi-agent System|Job-Shop Scheduling is the core contents of the CIMS research area and production logistics in the discrete manufacturing industry. To solve Job-Shop Scheduling problems, a scheduling model based on MAS (Multi-Agent-System) is presented with multiple applications of genetic algorithm (GA) and contract-net mechanism. In the model, the entities in the job-shop are abstracted as Task Agent, Resource Agent, Control Agent and Cooperation agent.

At the same time, the use of genetic algorithm processing of the final route selection makes a reasonable allocation of resources. At the same time, the scheduling optimization objectives and the factors disturbing job-shop scheduling are analyzed in the paper.

27|9130738|Journal Article|2021|Kiarash Aryankia|Neuro-Adaptive Formation Control and Target Tracking for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems With Time-Delay|This letter proposes an adaptive neural network-based backstepping controller that uses rigid graph theory to address the distance-based formation control problem and target tracking for nonlinear multi-agent systems with bounded time-delay and disturbance. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to overcome and compensate for the unknown nonlinearity and disturbance in the system dynamics. The effect of the state time-delay of the agents is alleviated by using an appropriate control signal that is designed based on specific Lyapunov function and Young';s inequality. The adaptive neural network (NN) weights tuning law is derived using this Lyapunov function. An upper bound for the singular value of the normalized rigidity matrix is introduced, and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the formation distance error is rigorously proven based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated through the simulation results on nonlinear multi-agent systems. Comparisons between the proposed distance-based method and an existing, displacement-based method are provided to evaluate the performance of the suggested method.
27|8572454|Conference Paper|2018|Zhenhua Xu|Containment Control for Fuzzy Multi-Agent Systems Subject to Stochastic Controller Gain Variation|This paper studies the containment control problem for a kind of nonlinear discrete-time multi-agent systems (MASs)with stochastic controller gain variation. More specifically, the nonlinear dynamics of MASs are modeled by the discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S)fuzzy systems, which can approximate many practical nonlinear systems in reality. Firstly, by introducing a stochastic variable and an uncertain term in the control protocol, a stochastic uncertain closed-loop system is derived that captures the stochastic controller gain variation phenomenon. By means of the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI)technique, a novel sufficient condition is obtained such that containment control for such a kind of nonlinear systems is achieved. Then, after some matrices manipulation, the controller gains are calculated by solving some LMIs. A numerical study is finally proposed for the validation of the controller design.

Drawing on the deception literature from social sciences and artificial intelligence, we propose a deception model which extends and integrates the past research on deception from multiple disciplines. In order to facilitate deception detection, we also develop a procedural model for deception detection. Application of both models to a real-world case scenario demonstrates that both models can be used to instill a better understanding of deception and to detect and remedy deception effectively.

A hybrid censoring strategy is developed to reach resilient consensus for cooperative agents in the directed networks in which some Byzantine agents are present. The number, location, and dynamics of Byzantine agents are assumed to be unavailable to the cooperative agents. Sufficient conditions based on network robustness are established when the number of Byzantine agents is locally bounded. They are further extended to cope with resilient scaled hybrid consensus where dictated ratios instead of a common value can be reached. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.

27|672966|Conference Paper|1997|Zheng Yang|A proposed framework for intelligent systems based on multi-agent conception|A framework based on multi agent conception is proposed, in order to construct a new type of intelligent system. Built under an intelligent human machine interface, it consists of three parts: an intelligent control unit, an agent generator and a library. The intelligent control unit is composed of a visualized task planner, a main control unit and a public information blackboard. Based on an agent shell architecture, the agent generator generates problem solving agents of different size according to a task planning diagram and available problem solving resources (including procedural, descriptive, controlling knowledge, models and static/dynamic data etc.). An agent interaction diagram is also generated to support and test the agent construction procedure. The third part-library, is an integration of bases which manage and store various kinds of resources that the system needs. Designing this framework will provide methods and implementation tools to meet the demand of establishing a new intelligent system in which many agents cooperatively work together to solve complex problems.
27|4624016|Conference Paper|2008|Yoe-Jin Yoon|Design and Implementation of Communication System among Heterogeneous Multi-Agent System|Unfortunately heterogeneous multi-agent systems use the different language to describe agents and services provided by agents. For example, there are Java agent development framework (JADE) and component-based autonomic layered middleware (CALM). The JADE uses agent communication language (ACL) and semantic language (SL) proposed by FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents). The ACL is a language to communicate between agents. And the SL is a language to specify the service description in ACL. However the CALM uses ACL and XML respectively. Due to the reasons, the multi-agent systems cannot communicate with each other. Therefore we propose a communication system with the translation engine to solve the problems.

However, the problem of inadequate marketing still remains. A prominent issue here is that the strategy of using different resources and contents to deliver information about the universities to their customers is inefficient because it does not solve the problem of identifying and delivering visitors'; preferences. Consequently, we propose a conceptual model of a dynamic and self-adaptive website design utilizing the concept of multi-agent semantics web approach to include an intelligent strategic marketing for the website. The proposed model consists of five components which are, Agent Generator System; Preferences Model Base; Grouping Process; Ontology Library; Semantic Web; and Rendering Engine. The outcome of this paper is a Conceptual Multi-agent Semantic Web Model that could be exploited to design a highly dynamic website that is expected to meet visitors'; preferences.

Patsouris|Coordinated flows in a formal multi-agent system based on a modal algebra|We develop a formal multi-agent system based on a modal algebra enabling us to preserve the essential characteristics of its autonomous software agents (autonomy, mobility, etc.), as well as to explore the formal properties and management of the cooperations (non-hierarchical or flat structures) and coordinations (hierarchical structures) among those simple agents, that can be constructed through the operations of the model. We show the potential of these operations that allow us to construct different cooperations and coordinations based on the same set of autonomous agents (as alternative solutions with respect to the same given problem), while, in parallel we provide the means in order to explicitly specify different types of coordinated flows of information specified and governed by these structures. We illustrate all the above via a number of algorithms referring to the development of a simple (in structure) data mining system. We simply selected an adequate application area with no purpose to compare data mining methods and techniques. The various algorithmic solutions we suggest, unveil the resilience of the alternative design approaches aiming at improving issues like decentralization of services, as well as enhancing performance through concurrent organization by thus exploiting the different possibilities of the model.
27|8806353|Conference Paper|2019|Jiankai Zuo|A Multi-Agent Collaborative Work Planning Strategy Based on AFSA-PSO Algorithm|Agent and multi-agent technology originates from the research of distributed artificial intelligence. The traditional control methods of multi-agent system are centralized and hierarchical from top to bottom, which violates the idea of the adaptability, flexibility and relative independence of agents, and has the fatal defect of over-dependence on the main controller. In this paper, an artificial fish swarm algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are combined to find the optimal solution and solve the problem of multi-agent cooperative work and path planning. Simulation results show that the multi-agent cooperative evolution based on AFSA-PSO algorithm can adapt to the dynamic changes of new tasks, and has not only a good global convergence, but also a fast local convergence rate, simple operation and few parameters.

A reinforcement learning approach was performed by the agents, however, this type of learning exploits exponentially when the number of states in the environment is very large. In that sense, the paper proposes to use the MaxQ-Q hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain a suitable policy for agents in order to minimize the time process to achieve the goal, and to reduce the state space. In addition, since the multi-agent system runs in a software application, a multi-threading paradigm was proposed to use. Experimental results show that this multi-agent system can reduce the time process and still maintain independence of agents.
28|886350|Conference Paper|2000|H. Nishiyama|Negotiation protocol for proof of realization of cooperative task in multi-agent robot systems|The authors propose a negotiation protocol for verifying the feasibility of a cooperative task. In our multiagent system, each agent has a knowledge base to make plans and prove the feasibility of the requested task. When a task request is received by an agent, the agent asks its own knowledge base whether the task is executable or not. If the agent recognizes that it needs another agent';s cooperation to execute the task, the agent requests other agents to verify whether the cooperation is acceptable. Using this protocol in a multiagent system that consists of heterogeneous agents, these agents verify the feasibility of a chain of cooperative tasks. In this framework, we design a multiagent system that consists of mobile robots, manipulators, camera robots and several sensors. We also perform complex tasks such as printing and delivering documents, and demonstrate the applicability of our proposal.

By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, the convergence and stability of the system are proved. Simulation examples are used to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.
28|1565520|Conference Paper|2005|L. Cao|Agent services-oriented architectural design of open complex agent systems|Architectural design is a critical phase in building agent-based systems. However, most of existing agent-oriented software engineering approaches deliver weak or incomplete supports for the architectural design of distributed and especially Internet-based agent systems. On the other hand, the emergence of service-oriented computing (SOC) brings in intrinsic mechanisms for complementing agent-based computing (ABC). In this paper, we investigate the dialogue between ABC and SOC and their integration in implementing architectural design. We synthesize them and develop the computational concept agent service, and build a new design approach called agent service-oriented architectural design (ASOAD). The ASOAD expands the contents and ranges of agent and ABC, and synthesize the qualities of SOC such as interoperability and openness with the performances of ABC like flexibility and autonomy. It is suitable for designing distributed agent systems and agent service-based enterprise application integration.
28|7379777|Conference Paper|2015|Shahrinaz Ismail|What if agents can determine success of ERP implementation?|Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) system is widely implemented in organisations across the globe. Despite the reported success rate, the challenges of implementing the system is not reducing in number. The most cited challenge in ERP implementation is at user requirement stage, in which the business process analysis is documented to meet the specifications of the system. Often at times, the deadline of an ERP implementation project is postponed multiple times due to the incompleteness of the documents prepared at this stage, partly because of miscommunication between vendor and client, perceived ease of document preparation by the vendor, and perceived ease of implementation by the client. The result of this postponement leads to increase of implementation cost and time, on top of risk of producing quality output. The question in hand is: what if software agents can be deployed to determine the success of an ERP implementation? This paper proposes the deployment of Get-Understand-Share-Connect (GUSC) Model to deploy agent roles within the document management environment during the user requirement stage of an ERP implementation. The expected contribution of this paper is a multi-agent system framework within this environment.

A necessary and sufficient condition for mean-square consensus of multiagent systems is obtained for the case of switching topology. Simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.
28|6896850|Conference Paper|2014|Xiaole Xu|Distributed observer-based consensus tracking of multi-agent systems with a reference leader|In this paper, the consensus tracking problem of multi-agent systems with a reference leader is considered. It is assumed that only a subset of the following agents can access to the state information of the leader, while all following agents can not be available the bounded reference input of the leader. The dynamics of the agents is given in general form of linear system and the communication topology among the agents is assumed to be undirected and connected. It is assumed that the states of all following agents can not be available directly. To achieve control objective, distributed and local observers are adopted to estimate the agent';s state respectively. To track the active leader, a discontinuous control protocol based on the state observers is proposed for each following agent. It is shown that under suitable conditions, all the following agents can track the leader under the designed controller and observers. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate our obtained result.

One of the most important functions in P2P system is locating resources. Dynamic joins and leaves of the node and heterogeneous network structure in a P2P system make it difficult to discover shared resources. We present a multi-agent approach for resource discovery in P2P systems. Agents maintain local resource information and mobile agents migrate on the network to discover shared resources. Empirical results verify that the be reduced greatly, ans scalability and robustness can also be improved.
28|4052976|Conference Paper|2006|Toshiharu Sugawara|Multi-Agent Systems Performance by Adaptive/Non-Adaptive Agent Selection|Our research interest lies in studying how local strategies about partner agent selection using reinforcement learning with variable exploitation-versus-exploration parameters influence the overall efficiency of multi-agent systems (MAS). An agent often has to select appropriate agents to assign tasks that are not locally executable. Unfortunately no agent in an open environment can understand the all states of all agents, so this selection must be done according to local information. In this paper we investigate how the overall performance of MAS is affected by their individual learning parameters for adaptive partner selections for collaboration. We show experimental results using simulation and discuss why the overall performance of MAS varies.
28|7306591|Conference Paper|2015|Jonathan Bonnet|Multi-satellite Mission Planning Using a Self-Adaptive Multi-agent System|Mission planning for a constellation of Earth observation satellites is a complex problem raising significant technological challenges for tomorrow';s space systems. The large numbers of customers requests and their dynamic introduction in the planning system result in a huge combinatorial search space with a potentially highly dynamical evolution requirements. The techniques used nowadays have several limitations, in particular, it is impossible to dynamically adapt the plan during its construction even for small modifications. Satellites of a constellation are planned in a chronological way instead of a more collective planning which can provide additional load balancing. In this paper, we propose to solve this difficult and highly dynamic problem using adaptive multi-agent systems, taking advantage from their self-adaptation and self-organization mechanisms. In the proposed system, the agents, through their local interactions, allow to dynamically reach a good solution, while ensuring a controlled distribution of tasks within the constellation of satellites. Finally, a comparison with a classical chronological greedy algorithm, commonly used in the spatial domain, highlights the advantages of the presented system.

Firstly, a DMPC-based consensus algorithm is proposed, where the constraints in the algorithm depend on the heterogeneous dynamics. We prove that the resultant DMPC optimization problem is feasible with the designed controllers, which is stable when the system reaches consensus. To further reduce communication cost and solve the problem with asynchronous discrete-time information exchange, self-triggered mechanism is introduced into the framework. Trigger intervals are alternatively optimized with the control inputs, and the influence on the system performance is analyzed. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms.

28|7582409|Journal Article|2018|Yasaman Khazaeni|Event-Driven Cooperative Receding Horizon Control for Multi-Agent Systems in Uncertain Environments|We propose an event-driven Cooperative Receding Horizon (CRH) controller to solve maximum reward collection problems (MRCP) where multiple agents cooperate to maximize the total reward collected from a set of targets in a given mission space. In previous work, a CRH controller was developed and in this paper, we overcome several limitations of this controller, including potential instabilities in the agent trajectories and poor performance due to inaccurate estimation of a reward-to-go function. Rewards are non-increasing functions of time and the environment is uncertain with new targets detected by agents at random time instants. The controller sequentially solves optimization problems over a planning horizon and executes the control for a shorter action horizon, where both are defined by certain events associated with new information becoming available. In contrast to the earlier CRH controller, we reduce the originally infinite-dimensional feasible control set to a finite set at each control update event. We prove some properties of this new controller and include simulation results showing its improved performance.

However parent selection and network awareness are not addressed properly in these leading studies. In order to fill this gap, we introduce the design and implementation of a Multi-agent System (MAS) for P2P video streaming in this paper. The construction of the MAS by applying a well-defined agent-oriented software engineering methodology is discussed.

Experimental results show that the proposed MAS succeeds the related parent selection and promotes the system execution. BDI-based MAS design given in this paper can guide those researchers who aim to implement autonomous mesh-based P2P video streaming systems.

The selection of partners is one of the key factors for the success of virtual enterprises. Multi-agent system is an incompact agent federation composed of many agents, with its characteristics identical to virtual enterprises. It is, therefore, reasonable and effective to apply to the selection of enterprises'; partner. The issue of trust is a hot topic in multi-agent system. The present trust model cannot well solve the problem of identifying the initial trust value of applicant agents. Moreover, there is room for improvement as to the calculation of agent trust value. This study puts forward a new trust management model based on multi-agent system. In the model, a fuzzy algorithm is used to calculate the initial value of the agent instead of a static definition. In addition, an independent validation module is used to test information reliability. Therefore, the problems of identifying initial trust value can be solved. Through system simulation, it is noted that based on the trust management model the cooperation rate has been enhanced and individual agent';s income has risen by a big margin.

The designed MAS is physically distributed so that agents representing elements of the microgrid exchange actual data, allowing for a new level of MAS system realization. Simulation results for the multi-agent based DC microgrid under some operating conditions are presented and discussed.

Vadde|Smart sensors in a flow-line manufacturing system: an agent-based simulation|Machine monitoring is key to enhancing the performance of a manufacturing system. Though both traditional and smart sensors can monitor machine health, smart sensors which have onboard processor offer certain advantages. In case of smart sensors the burden of sensor data processing is distributed where as it is centralized in traditional sensors case. This research investigates if the performance of a manufacturing system can be improved by monitoring machines through smart sensors. This study is conducted on a simulation model of a flow-line manufacturing system integrated with smart sensors. The model represents machines as agents. Taking sensor-based information into consideration, machine agents negotiate with one another to arrive at a machine maintenance schedule just-in-time to avert machine failures. Simulation results indicate that smart sensors can significantly increase both the uptime efficiency and the production rate of the flow-line manufacturing system.

29|5364680|Conference Paper|2009|Nariman Mani|Runtime Monitoring of Multi-agent Manufacturing Systems for Deadlock Detection Based on Models|There is an increasing demand for the multi-agent systems (MAS) in the automation of manufacturing systems. However, similar to other distributed systems, autonomous agents'; interaction in the automated manufacturing systems (AMS) can potentially lead to runtime behavioral failures including deadlock. Deadlocks can cause major financial consequences by negatively affecting the production cost and time. Therefore, a multi-agent manufacturing system should be monitored against the unwanted emergent behaviors such as deadlocks. In this paper, we propose a monitoring technique for deadlock detection in multi-agent manufacturing system based on the MAS design models. In this technique, the MAS is instrumented with a dedicated communication protocol to use the potential deadlock information derived from the design models to propagate deadlock detection query messages. The technique is able to reduce the message communication overhead among the agents by limiting the number of agents that the deadlock detection query messages should be initiated to.

As different types of power converters can be involved in the same system, advanced load management scheme is required to ensure stable and optimal operation under various conditions. In this paper, a heterogeneous multi-agent system model is established for the load demand management of a zonal medium voltage DC shipboard power system, where different types of DC-DC converters with diverse conversion ratios are considered as heterogeneous agents. Then, a flocking based cooperative control protocol is designed to achieve the group objective, where navigational feedback is introduced to ensure that each agent runs within a limited range. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model.

29|8782631|Journal Article|2019|Qiang Jia|Synchronization of Multi-Agent Systems With Time-Varying Control and Delayed Communications|This paper investigates the synchronization problem of nonlinear multi-agent systems with time-varying control in the presence of transmission delay over a communication network. To facilitate the study, a novel delayed differential inequality with time-varying coefficients is first established. Then, the synchronization problem is recast into the stability problem of a delayed differential system with certain time-dependent parameter. A sufficient criterion is further formulated to guarantee the synchronization. The mathematical proof reveals that the time average of the control strength is crucial for reaching synchronization. Together with the agent dynamics and the topology, this average also governs the largest admissible delay. Moreover, the criterion is applied to synchronization problems with general on-off coupling under data sampling and delayed communications, respectively. Some useful corollaries are consequently deduced. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the validity of our theoretical results.

Furthermore, the impact of information interconnection structure on the damping performance is addressed. Finally, the simulation results in the 2-area 4-generator power system show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper focuses on the possibility of implementing hybrid agent platforms in full compliance with Real Time Specification for Java and with JADE, a popular middleware based on the agent paradigm. Our approach offers several advantages: it is less sensitive to time fluctuations in thread synchronization, it is FIPA compliant, requires relatively little changes in existing architectures and it may be integrated without much trouble in large Java-based distributed applications. Two reference scenarios - the ';dummy'; threads and real-time agent execution - are taken into account. For this purpose, an autonomous vehicle system was developed. The average time delay between agents (threads) behaviour execution is determined as a performance index. This work investigates the effect of different platforms and capacity.

This paper describes a model, based on the behavior of honeybees, for finding a new home when the old one gets destroyed. The particular problem is an example of a complex system and has many applications in robotics and is therefore an interesting problem to both biologists and engineers. In this paper, a number of experiments were carried out to understand how microscopic rules in swarms of agents lead to a macroscopic behavior in the swarm. Experimental results show how different factors including the quorum size and the distance to the best hive affect the decision making process for finding a suitable home when a number of homes of different qualities are available in the environment. Experimental results are found to be consistent with the biological counterparts.

Rigorous proof shows that the systems output can reach synchronization in a finite time and the final consensus states are the leader';s states. In addition, for some special second-order multi-agent systems, a bounded finite-time output feedback controller can also be designed.

For random packet losses, a Bernoulli-distributed white sequence is used to describe packet dropouts among agents in a stochastic way. For deterministic packet losses, a switched system with stable and unstable subsystems is employed to model packet dropouts in a deterministic way. The purpose of this paper is to derive consensus criteria, such that linear multi-agent systems with sampled-data and packet losses can reach consensus. By means of the Lyapunov function approach and the decomposition method, the design problem of a distributed controller is solved in terms of convex optimization. The interplay among the allowable bound of the sampling interval, the probability of random packet losses, and the rate of deterministic packet losses are explicitly derived to characterize consensus conditions. The obtained criteria are closely related to the maximum eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix versus the second minimum eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, which reveals the intrinsic effect of communication topologies on consensus performance. Finally, simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.
30|6876221|Journal Article|2015|Xianyong Feng|A Multi-Agent System Framework for Real-Time Electric Load Management in MVAC All-Electric Ship Power Systems|All-electric ship power systems include less generation capacity and smaller rotating inertia compared with large power systems. The systems include large portions of nonlinear loads and dynamic loads, which may reduce the stability margin. Moreover, various operational constraints, such as system frequency constraint, motor voltage constraint and dynamic cable constraint, need to be satisfied in operational real time. Further, pulse loads draw very high short-time power in an intermittent way, which may significantly deteriorate the power quality of the system. In this paper, a novel multi-agent system cooperative controller for a medium voltage AC (MVAC) system of all-electric ship power systems is developed to balance load and generation in real time while satisfying system';s operational constraints and considering load priorities. The new method coordinates the pulse load and the propulsion load to reduce the impact of pulse load changes on the power quality of all-electric ship power systems. The dynamic behavior of the new method is evaluated using case studies in PSCAD software.
30|1599265|Conference Paper|2005|J.M. Solanki|Using intelligent multi-agent systems for shipboard power systems reconfiguration|Many approaches have been taken on the reconfiguration of power systems, but most of these approaches use a centralized method. While these methods can be acceptable for terrestrial power system applications, doing reconfiguration on shipboard power systems has a different set of issues involved. For naval ships, that may experience damage during battle, a centralized reconfiguration method provides a limitation. Based on these constraints researchers are investigating decentralized control strategies that allow for reconfiguration using localized information. One newer technology that is showing promise in this area is intelligent multi-agent (IMA) systems. This paper discusses efforts underway at Mississippi State University to use IMA systems for reconfiguration of the power system. Agents are being implemented in multiple formats including Matlab and JADE to investigate the issues related to data sharing, communications and reconfiguration strategies

In this paper, two types of these disciplines, each of which constructs an organization for agents, are explained and their performances in voltage control of a power system (in the context of steady state regime) are examined and compared on Nordic32 as test power system. These MASs may be implemented as the main structure of a wide area monitoring, protection and control (WAMPAC) system.
30|6524205|Conference Paper|2013|Preeti Sethi|A multi-agent hybrid protocol for data fusion and data aggregation in non-deterministic wireless sensor networks|Data fusion deals with collaborative in-network processing and gathers relatively accurate information about the events in the environment. Conventional data fusion algorithms when assisted with mobile agent technology shifts computationally intensive tasks to these intelligent units thereby increasing the lifetime of the network. There exist mobile agent based event driven protocols for accumulating and forwarding the information to the sink(base station) eg: Tree-based Itinerary Design [4]. Usually, such protocols either deploy value-based fusion or decision-based fusion but very few are using both at the same time. Moreover, use of multi-agent systems(MAS) in such protocols is still in its infancy. The focus of this work is thus to propose a multi-agent hybrid protocol exploiting the benefits of both value and decision fusion by performing aggregation at the source level in a clustered WSN.
30|6760996|Conference Paper|2013|Rong Su|Synthesis of control protocols for multi-agent systems with similar actions|In this paper we investigate supervisor synthesis for a multi-agent system whose components'; alphabets are bijectively similar to each other, i.e., they are ‚Äúidentical‚Äù under a pre-specified one-to-one relabeling scheme. We first introduce the concept of multi-agent systems with similar actions. Then we formulate a problem of control protocol synthesis, which aims to compute a supervisor template whose instantiations (via event relabeling) associated with local components form a distributed supervisor. After that, we show that protocol synthesis is always feasible for decomposable requirements, while the existence of a protocol is undecidable for an indecomposable requirement. In the former case, algorithms are presented to compute a protocol when a multi-agent system and a decomposable requirement is given, and in the latter case a conservative requirement decomposition algorithm is provided.

The Multi Agent Systems (MAS) Technology is actually the most suitable to face its emerging challenges, such as complex management and control, self-healing with necessity of collaboration and communication to solve a local or global problem, and many other problematic aspects. Nowadays, there is no complete environment to simulate MAS. The Agent Oriented Programming is based on multithreading, while the simulation tools don';t allow it or causes their instability. Our solution consists on combining these technologies to take benefit from their advantages and strength with available features and characteristics to model and simulate smart grid as a MAS. That leads to demand side management optimization and meets the smart grid objectives and requirements.
30|1368415|Conference Paper|2004|R.C. Parks|Attacking agent-based systems|Agent-based systems add unique aspects to assessment activity and require the use of traditional tools and techniques in new or unconventional ways and the development of new, domain-customized tools. Agent-based system assessments must address the same issues as those of traditional systems: unsafe programming practices, such as failure to validate inputs or use of insecure libraries. Assessments of agent-based systems should also include &#034;system-of-systems&#034; concepts. Complex systems interact with and rely on other systems that may exist independently. A system-of-systems assessment identifies systems and their behaviors and considers ways that those behaviors can interact to harm the complex system. Attacks are then developed to cause the desired behavior. Agent-based systems are aware of and respond to their environment through adaptation and evolution. They require assessment through concepts normally reserved for humans. Just as adversaries cause humans to react in ways advantageous to the attacker, agent-based system assessors must cause agents to react. These assessments require &#034;social engineering&#034; of the agents just as simpler systems may require &#034;social engineering&#034; of users and administrators. This paper discusses the application of existing and new tools and techniques to agent system assessments including descriptions of actual and theoretical attacks.

Finally, some numerical examples are simulated to verify our theoretical results.
30|8926653|Conference Paper|2019|Lucas Sakurada|Development of Agent-Based CPS for Smart Parking Systems|The increase volume of vehicles circulating in large cities and the limited space for parking are factors that motivate the adoption of systems capable of dealing with such problems. In this context, smart parking systems are suitable solutions to avoid the traffic congestion, the air pollution and the long search to find a free parking spot. The inclusion of emergent ICT technologies and artificial intelligence techniques, and particularly using multi-agent systems, combined under the scope of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), ensure flexibility, modularity, adaptability and the decentralization of intelligence through autonomous, cooperative and proactive entities. Such smart parking systems can be easily adapted to any type of vehicle to be parked and scalable in terms of the number of parking spots and drivers/vehicles. A fundamental issue in these agent-based CPS parking systems is the interconnection between the cyber and physical counterparts, i.e. between the software agents and the physical asset controllers to access the parking spots. This paper focuses on developing an agent-based CPS for a smart parking system and particularly addressing how the software agents are interconnected with the physical asset controllers using proper Internet of Things technologies. The proposed approach was implemented in two distinct parking systems, one for bicycles and another for cars, showing an efficient, modular, adaptable and scalable operation.

Moreover, the control coefficients are unknown and cannot be lower or upper bounded by known constants. By virtue of adaptive control technique, Lyapunov theory, algebraic graph theory and Barbalat';s lemma, it is proved that the states of the multi-agent systems can achieve consensus under the assumption that the interconnection topology is undirected and connected. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
30|9336836|Conference Paper|2020|Shun Yang|Artificial Potential-Based Formation Control with Collision and Obstacle Avoidance for Second-order Multi-Agent Systems|A formation control strategy with collision avoidance and obstacle avoidance mechanisms is proposed for second-order continuous multi-agent systems (MAS) under a directed topology. The control objectives can be achieved by introducing artificial potential field (APF) methods and the leader-follower formation methods. The leader-follower formation methods are employed to assist follower agents to obtain the coordination of positions and consensus of velocities with the leader-agent, the control objectives of formation generation and formation maintenance can be achieved. In the APF methods, obstacles and agents are regarded as high potential fields. The repulsive forces provided by the potential fields can solve the problems of avoiding collisions among agents and avoiding the extern-obstacles. By using Lyapunov stability theory and graph theory, the fact, the stability of the closed-loop MAS can be guaranteed, is proven. In the end, the simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed formation control strategy.
30|6261030|Conference Paper|2012|Prithviraj Dasgupta|Multi-agent coordination techniques for multi-robot task allocation and multi-robot area coverage|Multi-robot systems have emerged as a central research theme within robotics with applications in several domains that require automated robotic assistants such as unmanned search and rescue, automated surveillance and reconnaissance operations, automated civilian transportation, extra-terrestrial exploration, and even domestic applications such as agriculture, lawn mowing, vacuum cleaning, etc. One of the major computational challenges in multi-robot systems is to design appropriate coordination techniques between the robots that enable them to perform operations efficiently in terms of time, cost and energy expended while keeping the system robust to individual robot failures as well as scalable in the number of robots. Coordination technologies from the field of multi-agent systems offer a rich array of solutions that can be adapted to multi-robot sytems. In this talk, we will summarize our research on two operations that are frequently encountered in many multi-robot domains, namely, multi-robot area coverage [1] and multi-robot task allocation [2]. First, we will describe a coalition game theory based technique for dynamically reconfiguring multi-robot teams by splitting or merging them, when they encounter obstacles while covering an initially unknown environment. We will introduce two heuristics that, given the set of robots requiring reconfiguration, guarantee rapid convergence to the appropriate partition of the set of robots while taking into consideration the physical characteristics of the robots and the environment [3]. Secondly, I will describe a distributed, auction-based multirobot task allocation algorithm called DynamicBids [4] that improves the performance of tasks and significantly reduces the communication overhead between robots by allowing a bidder robot to selectively revise its bids on tasks if that improves the cost of the schedule of the tasks to the bidder robot. For both techniques, we will describe analytical results, and, experimental results from simulations on the Webots simulator as well as on physical robots. Finally, we will demonstrate our ongoing work on autonomous, multi-robot landmine detection that uses the techniques mentioned above to coordinate a set of robots, fitted with different types of landmine detection sensors, to potentially improve the accuracy with which landmines can be detected [5].

Because of incomplete information and ontological heterogeneity, an agent can partially understand the contents of other ontologies. This makes multi-agent communication rather difficult. In this paper, we utilize semantic approximation for implementing better multi-agent communication based on partial shared distributed ontologies, and hence achieve coordination query among multiple agents. We also developed a multi-agent coordination system based on semantic approximation

First, in order to reduce the communication burden in the multi-agent network, a distributed event-triggered consensus control is designed by taking into account the effect of the nonlinear interconnections. Then, based on the Lyapunov functional method and the Kronecker product technique, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the consensus in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, a simulation example is proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed theory.

30|5069949|Conference Paper|2009|Mehran Ziadloo|On the hardness of negotiations in multi-agent systems|In multi-agent negotiation the difficulty of the problem depends on how many issues are under negotiation and how complex agents'; utility functions are. In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating different techniques for solving negotiation problems and used it to show how hard a negotiation problem can become. We used mediated single text negotiation protocol with genetic algorithms mediator and hill climber agents. Negotiations were conducted over deals with binary issues presented as binary strings. Utility functions with binary and higher levels of dependency between issues were used. Our results show that size of problem does not affect performance, until higher levels of dependency between issues are presented in utility functions. Genetic algorithm method was able to solve the problem with relatively good performance in all levels of dependency that we tested.

Random delays during transmission seriously affect the convergence performance of multi-agent formation. Based on one-step random time-delay model, the transition matrix of system is derived, which contains the impact factors of random delays. A learning control scheme is proposed and the convergence of system tracking errors is guaranteed. Simulation results show that the convergence rate is reduced when the probabilities of time-delay are getting higher.
30|7821780|Conference Paper|2016|Muna Saif Al Rahbi|Multi-agent based framework for person re-identification in video surveillance|Multi-agent based systems have been used in a number of practical application domains. However their use in computer vision based systems that often provide solutions to automated video surveillance, remains in its infancy. Addressing this gap in research this paper proposes a novel design, based on multi-agents, to address one of the most important open research problems in video surveillance, i.e. person re-identification. The re-design of a typical computer vision based solution for the problem is based on our analysis of the problem considering how a human observer would successfully carry out person re-identification. Hence the proposed approach mimics human behavior and promises many advantages over the existing approaches that do not consider such a human behavior based approach. We provide preliminary experimental results to justify the contribution of the proposed novel approach to person re-identification and conclude the paper with insights to future research that has potential for a new paradigm of research in person re-identification in video surveillance.

This paper proposed a solution to multi-agent credit assignment problem. The contribution is to equip the critic agent (who is responsible for distributing reinforcements among agents) with learning capability. Some criteria are used to propose an inner feedback to the critic. Results of simulation show the applicability of the method to a task, which has the characteristic that the agent has to decide from a large set of actions. The research is a preliminary step to more in-depth thinking for a solution to multi-agent critic assignment.
30|6896895|Conference Paper|2014|Rui Li|Finite-time formation control for second-order multi-agent systems|In this paper, a finite-time formation control problem is studied for second-order multi-agent systems. A control protocol is first constructed to achieve the consensus of the multi-agent systems in finite-time with the steady-state velocity being an arbitrary specific value. Then by introducing a virtual agent, called as pre-correction agent, the formation control protocol is designed, and the convergency of the control protocol is proved. Furthermore, a control protocol without velocity measurements is designed to achieve the finite-time formation with both the steady-state velocity and position being arbitrary specific values. In addition, since the obtained protocols include free communicate parameters, different performance can be achieved by assigning the free parameters. Finally, illustrative examples are solved, including an optimal formation problem with communicate parameters as selection variables, which illustrate the efficiency and potential engineering application of the proposed control methods.

Under the assumption that the topology is connected and every agent receives neighbors information with time-varying communication delay, allowable delay bound depending on the agent dynamics, topology structure and the control gain is obtained. In particular, in case of first-order integrator systems, any large yet bound delay is tolerant for consensus. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical result is illustrated through numerical example.
30|8407989|Conference Paper|2018|Xuesong Zhou|Research on Power System Restoration Based on Multi-agent Systems|This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to power system restoration. So far, numerous studies have been conducted on power system restoration problems. From the view point of the system structures, these researches can be divided into two categories: centralized systems and decentralized systems. In this study, we have solved the distribution power system restoration problem by using multi-agent approach, which is categorized in the distributed approach. The solved solutions have been compared with the solutions which were solved by the mathematical programming approach. From the simulation results, it can be seen the proposed restoration method could reach the right solution by making use of only local information. The solution quality is equivalent to the quality of the centralized system. This means that the proposed multi-agent restoration system is a promising approach to more large-scale distribution network.

Intelligent agent software is written to realize the proposed intelligent agent model. The same software is then used to simulate the herding problem with one sheep and one dog. Simulation results show that the proposed intelligent agent is successful in establishing a goal (herding) and learning other agents'; behaviors.

Ramanujam|Design of a multi-agent system for autonomous database administration|As more and more businesses and services find themselves online due to the Internet phenomenon, a plethora of information sources is now available. These trends have rendered databases an indispensable component of daily life and have increased their complexity significantly, which has, in turn, amplified the workload on database administrators (DBAs). This has given rise to an increasing need for self-managing and self-administering databases. We present the analysis and design of a novel and innovative solution to address the problem of overburdened and expensive DBAs. We propose a self-administering wrapper around database systems in the form of an intelligent multi-agent system tool that autonomously and rationally administers and maintains relational databases. A planned implementation of the agent-based system which proactively or reactively identifies and resolves a small sub-set of DBA tasks is discussed and the Gaia methodology is used to outline the detailed analysis and design of the same using role models and interaction models. A brief description of the functionalities, responsibilities and components of each agent in the planned multi-agent system is presented.

Fazlollahi|Multi-agent decision support system incorporating fuzzy logic|Rapid advances in intelligent agents and agent-based systems have been attracting the attention of academicians and practitioners. Intelligent agents have attractive properties including autonomy, proactiveness, intelligence, social ability and other useful features. The field of DSS can benefit significantly by focusing on the above concerns through employment of agent-based technologies. This work proposes a framework for a single decision task DSS based on multi-agent architecture. The agents in the DSS employ fuzzy rules and fuzzy objectives when generating alternative decisions. The approach is demonstrated using the investment multi-agent DSS (MADSS) prototype. The experiments show that the fuzzy MADSS outperforms the traditional model plus data based DSS.

A linear transformation approach is applied, which transforms the state consensus problem of the uncertain MASs into the robust quadratic partial stability problem of a corresponding linear parameter-varying (LPV) system. In doing the linear transformation, an incidence matrix is established as the transformation matrix, which can make the original uncertain system transformed into a reduced-order system. According to this decomposed system, quadratic stabilization system with robust controller is designed. The controller construction mainly relies on solving a finite linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to approximate, and in the meantime the control gain matrix of the proposed distributed robust consensus protocol is also designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by two examples.

So the quondam manual diagnosis and the fault diagnosis method by traditional single expert system cannot adapt to the request of monitoring and diagnosis to modern complex equipment any more. In this paper, a distributed intelligent condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system function model based on multi-Agent with the idea of component is established, and the structure and function of each Agent in this model is described in detail. By cooperation of multi-agent, this model system can adequately utilize distributed knowledge, information and technology resource to improve the adaptability to dynamic environment of monitoring and diagnosis system, and the distributed computation and problem solving can be realized in network environment. This model that has a certain guidance meaning for realization of the distributed intelligent monitoring and diagnosis system, is helpful to build an integrated, intelligent and network diagnosis system. It can give a gist to establish distributed intelligent monitoring and diagnosis system for large-scale complex equipment.

31|6458561|Conference Paper|2012|Sara Maalal|A generic agent-oriented model used fordesigning a collaborative information system|Faced with new environmental constraints, firms decide to collaborate in collective entities and adopt new patterns of behavior. So, this firms'; collaboration becomes an unavoidable approach. This collaboration can be represented by many agents collaboration within a multi agent system. Indeed, agent technology is a software paradigm that permits to implement large and complex distributed applications [1]. In order to assist analyzing, conception and development or implementation phases of multi-agent systems, we';ve tried to present a practical application of a generic and scalable method of a MAS with a component-oriented architecture and agent-based approach that allows MDA to generate source code from a given model. We have designed a generic class diagram as a class meta-model of different agents of a MAS. Then we have applied it on a collaborative platform based on MAS supply chain which ensures cooperation and information logging and sharing between partners in real time. We have finally generated the model source code developed using an open source tool called AndroMDA. This agent-based and evolutive approach enhances the modularity and genericity developments and promotes their reusability in future developments.

31|7169241|Conference Paper|2015|Nuwan Ganganath|Cluster-based informed agents selection for flocking with a virtual leader|Recent literature on flocking in multi-agent systems show that a minority of informed agents in a group of dynamic agents can influence a majority to follow a virtual leader. However, it is not reported how to select these informed agents from the group in order to increase the number of agents which will eventually follow the virtual leader. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based informed agents selection method to achieve this objective. The proposed method enables us to select informed agents such that they are spatially evenly distributed within the group of agents. We carried out extensive simulations to analyze performances of the proposed method against the traditional random-based informed agents selection method. Simulation results show that the proposed method can increase the number of agents which eventually follow the virtual leader for a given number of informed agents. Therefore, the proposed cluster-based informed agents selection method is useful for leading the majority of a group with less number of informed agents.

This paper takes a broad-brush look at a relatively recent development in milli and micro robots, Diamagnetic Micro Manipulation (DM3) systems, in a multi-agent context. We report various multi-agent operations, such as multi-agent part manipulation, robots-acting-on-other-robots for enhanced functionality, and robot-supplied local feed, to assess the state of the art of this new type of system. In addition, we explore and analyze the multi-agent implications of known DM3 properties and earlier single-agent results to motivate future research in this area. As reported here, some of these multi-agent implications include mobile high-precision sensor transducers, near-field communications channels using robots as both transmitters and receivers, and novel swarm architectures.

In a MAS, numerous agents operate autonomously, but each agent is required to make decisions by considering other agents. Thus, agent cooperation is an important feature of a MAS. In this study, we focus on a MAS where the agents make connections by reinforcement learning. We propose a method that allows agents to learn and cooperate via communication. The actions of other agents are added to the state of each agent. Each agent performs virtual action selection and communicates with other agents to produce each action output.

31|5203302|Conference Paper|2009|Cheng Tao|An Extensible Multi-agent Based Traffic Simulation System|Agent technology is rapidly emerging as a powerful computing paradigm to cope with the complexity in dynamic distributed systems, such as microscopic traffic simulation systems. However, while a number of agent-based microscopic traffic simulation systems have been proposed and the multi-agent systems have been studied, to the best of our knowledge, the extensibility and interoperability have not been taken into account in this field. In this paper, we propose to integrate an extensible environmental information sensing (EIS) technology with multi-agent systems to enhance the ability of the traffic simulation systems to deal with increasing complex and large scale road network. In particular, we have developed an IEEE FIPA compliant traffic simulation system called JADE (Java based Agent Development Framework) based traffic simulation system (JTSS). The use of EIS decouples underlying infrastructure of road network and driver vehicle agents that makes it much easier to migrate between hosts of connected networks. The simulation of using multi-host deployment demonstrates that JTSS offers great flexibility in simulating large scale traffic systems.
31|9567851|Conference Paper|2021|Shafiza Ariffin Kashinath|Exploring the Role of Agent and Multi-Agent in Data Fusion Systems|Data fusion methods reduce the effort of data processing systems and facilitate achieving optimum results for complex problems. Recently, various complex and distributed systems such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems are implemented where many sensors and data sources are allocated to collect heterogeneous data. These systems demand innovative and advanced data fusion methods. This paper presents an overview of agent and multi-agent roles in data fusion methods. Basically, agents provide features that enable complex and distributed systems to achieve deep data fusion in a collaborative multi-agent environment. Interaction among agents allows disseminating global overviews to a localized set of data fusion modules. There are different architectures to establish communication and authority among agents, such as (1) centralized, (2) decentralized, and (3) hybrid. Each of these approaches affords essential attributes of multi-agent systems (MAS). As a result, agents have the ability to improve communication and decision-making among data fusion modules and ensure producing better features or values during the fusion processes.
31|4493647|Conference Paper|2008|Hani Mahdi|MASCE: A Multi-Agent System for Collaborative E-Learning|E-learning has become one of the most popular teaching methods in recent years. One of its modes is the blended learning where learners can read teaching materials asynchronously from a teaching website and collaborate with their peers, while providing for necessary face-to-face explanation, discussion, and physical operation in the classroom. In the computational intelligence field, the intelligent agent paradigm gained a tremendous interest in many application domains over the last two decades . This research project paper focuses on the use of intelligent agents in the sphere of e-learning education with the help of collaborative learning. Intelligent agents - the so called e-assistants or helper programs - can sit inside a computer and make the learning in e- learning happen dynamically to suit the need of the user. They can trap the user';s likes and dislikes in various areas, the level of knowledge and the learning style and accordingly recommend the best matching helpers for collaboration. The paper introduces a multi-agent system for collaborative e-learning (MASCE). MASCE is to assist teaching and learning process and also to encourage collaborative learning among peers. This system shall be used in a blended learning environment as a supplement to the face-to-face lecture where students can use the system in the lab or from home after attending the traditional lecture in the faculty. The objective is to incorporate the intelligence of the multi- agent system (MAS) in a way that enables it to actively and intelligently support the educational processes, where multiple agents can interact to exchange information so that students may collaborate on how best to gain knowledge.

32|4591343|Conference Paper|2008|Ying Wang|An Agent-Based Multi-issue Negotiation Model|Most of the current agent systems focus on single issue, such as price, whereas multi-issue negotiation is very essential to electronic commerce. In the multi-issue model, MAUT (Multi-attribute Utility Theory) or its derived theory is mainly used as the evaluation method. However, the application of this theory may cause deviation. To resolve the problem, a two stage negotiation model is presented in this paper. In the first stage, the negotiation theory is used to negotiate over the most important issue or the issues combination. In the second stage we reverse auction the product each issue at one time according to the issue importance from the smallest to the most important using the adjusted auction theory.

Then the experimental prototype system is designed and developed based on the swarm platform and java language, and some analysis data is produced by the prototype system.

The effectiveness of the multi-agent system for controlling traffic signals is established through simulations. The multi-agent system used controls multi traffic signals. The results are promising, and they support the expandability of the model used using hierarchical fuzzy logic systems and multi-agent systems.

Therefore it can help a dyeing enterprise to achieve the integrated management and control function, thus realize the purpose of quick response production.

32|7397351|Conference Paper|2015|Artur Freitas|Integrating Ontologies with Multi-Agent Systems through CArtAgO Artifacts|Several advantages can be obtained by allowing multi-agent systems to easily access ontologies, for example, in scenarios where agents make their decisions based on the knowledge provided by ontologies. Thus, this paper presents an infrastructure to allow the use of web ontologies in different agent-oriented platforms. The agents use this infrastructure layer as a tool for storing, accessing and querying domain-specific OWL ontologies. As a result, this layer allows an integration of agent platforms with semantic web data and ontologies. We exemplify in practice how agents, coded in one such platform, can use the proposed access layer to ontological reasoning engines, as well as which features can be obtained from it. The performance of this semantic infrastructure is evaluated and compared against usual knowledge representation in agent programming.
32|8869341|Conference Paper|2019|Takumi Furusaka|A Multi-agent System with Dual-rate Control and a Quantized-value Communication Constraint|Multi-agent systems (MASs) are used for distributed control purposes and substantial research attention has been directed to these systems because of their practical merits. In MASs, agents'; information is shared through networks. In networked-control systems, the measured data is usually quantized because of sensor performance or specification, and its resolution is inadequate. Furthermore, because of network quality, the measurement interval is often longer than the control interval. Therefore, the present study introduces a design method for a dual-rate quantized control system, in which the measurement interval of agents is an integer multiple of the control interval.
32|5687443|Conference Paper|2010|Yu Wei|Consensus problems in multi-agent Continuous-time systems with time-delays|This paper researches the problem of information consensus in networked multi-agent Continuous-time systems in the presence of undirected connected graph and different time delays. The analysis showed the essential relationship between the information consensus of multi-agent systems and the stability of continuous-time systems. Based on the theories of generalized Nyquist stability criterion and eigenvalue, it derived a sufficient condition to ensure the consensus of multi-agent continuous-time systems in the presence of undirected connected graph and input time delay. The simulation results coincide with the theoretical analysis, with the condition of undirected connected graph, and when the input delays are less than or equal to the standard delays given by the sufficient condition, the multi-agent systems can achieve consensus asymptotically.

32|7531362|Conference Paper|2016|Dezheng Zhu|Consensus algorithm of multi-agents without velocity measurement in a non-rectangular bounded space|In this paper, we consider coordinated motion and cooperative control of multi-agents in a non-rectangular bounded space, and present a consensus algorithm for the agents with double-integrator dynamics. The traditional consensus algorithm for bounded space is only applied into rectangular bouncing boundaries, not suitable for non-rectangular space. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the mirrored velocity and position matrix that not only can convert the discontinuous real velocity into the continuous mirrored velocity, but also can expand a bounded space into an infinite space. The velocity-free consensus algorithm in a bounded space is proposed. Because of the fact that many previous algorithms require speed feedback, then the method of state observation is used to get the estimated velocity, and the corresponding control law is also put forward. Finally, by using the Matlab numerical simulation, the correctness of the algorithm is well verified. The velocity and position of multi-agents asymptotically converge to the same values, respectively.
32|6041420|Conference Paper|2011|Mahmoud Hossein Zadeh|A self-healing architecture for web services based on failure prediction and a multi agent system|Failures during web service execution may depend on a wide variety of causes. One of those is loss of Quality of Service (QoS). Failures during web service execution impose heavy costs on services-oriented architecture (SOA). In this paper, we seek to achieve a self-healing architecture to reduce failures in web services. We believe that failure prediction prevents the occurrence of failures and enhances the performance of SOA. The proposed architecture consists of three agents: Monitoring, Diagnosis and Repair. Monitoring agent measures quality parameters in communication level and predicts future values of quality parameter by Time Series Forecasting (TSF) with the help of Neural Network (NN). Diagnosis agent analyzes current and future QoS parameters values for diagnose web service failures. Based on its algorithm, the Diagnosis agent detects failures and faults in web services executions. Repair agent manages repair actions by using Selection agent.

Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel intelligent multi-agent approach for flood disaster forecasting based on case based reasoning. Firstly, the proposed framework is constructed by three main modules, which are &#034;Front end user computer&#034;, &#034;Back end server&#034; and &#034;Flood disaster forecasting servers&#034;. Particularly, the proposed flood disaster forecasting system is made of several agents, in which each agent is designed to implement a particular functional unit. Secondly, the flood disaster forecasting algorithm is illustrated. In our algorithm, each agent has its own case base and can not visit the case base of other agents directly, and each case is made up of a problem part and a solution part. Finally, experiments are conduct to make performance evaluation based on the &#034;Active Archive of Large Floods, 1985-Present&#034; dataset. From the experimental results, the conclusions can be drawn that the proposed algorithm can predict the water level accurately, and the forecasting error rate of our algorithm is lower than exisiting method.

We describe a multiple bus electrical power system (multi-bus power system) as a market environment that consists of BDI bus agents representing two different characters, consumer and producer. The bus agents are able to balance the power system between power generation and load consumption while producers and consumers exploring the market and trading the power resource. In addition, the power system can be split into power branches by the bus agents naturally and efficiently. When a fault occurs in the system, the bus agents can maximize the capacity of the served loads or minimize the loss of power loads (when load shedding may be the only option) in a timely manner. The proposed BDI multi-agent approach can be applied to any size and structure of the multi-bus power systems. It is shown from our simulation and results comparison that the proposed approach becomes more effective and efficient when the scale of the multi-bus power system is getting larger.
33|7914490|Conference Paper|2016|H S V S Kumar Nunna|A multi-agent system for energy management in smart microgrids with distributed energy storage and demand response|This paper proposes a multi-agent system based microgrid energy management framework to balance the energy supply and demand by feasibly integrating the distributed energy storage and demand response (DR). The main contribution of this paper is an energy management system which schedules the operation of distributed energy storage systems (DESSs) and DR loads based on the day-ahead forecast data to minimise the energy mismatches in the system by taking the preferences set by the owners and life depletion costs of DESSs. The target schedule prepared based on the forecast information is adjusted in real-time to compromise the uncertainties and forecast errors. Besides scheduling the energy resources, the proposed management systems organises an energy spot market to settle the energy demand and supply quotes of end-users and distributed generators (DGs). The developed multi-agent systems is applied to a microgrid case study to verify its performance. The simulation results and their analysis suggest that the proposed microgrid energy management system is effective in managing the energy under uncertainties.
33|1599299|Conference Paper|2005|T. Hiyama|Hierarchical stabilization control with upper level multi-agent based controller and lower level local controller|This paper presents a hierarchical stabilization control system with a multi-agent based upper level stabilization controller and a lower level local stabilization controller. Two types of intelligent agents are proposed to realize the proposed upper level stabilization controller: a monitoring agent for gathering required information to stabilize the target power system and a stabilization control agent(supervisor) which performs the actual stabilization control on the selected device. All the required information is distributed through computer networks. The lower level stabilization controller utilizes only local information monitored at the site of the controlled device. Whenever interferences of computer networks happen, the multi-agent based stabilization controller is not able to continue the proper control action to stabilize the target power system. Therefore, under such circumstances the control system is switched to the lower level local stabilization controller to continue the stabilization control. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical stabilization control scheme, experimental studies have been performed on a 5kVA laboratory system with the energy capacitor system as an energy storage device for the stabilization control.

33|9386261|Journal Article|2021|Yang Fei|Robust Formation Control for Multi-Agent Systems: A Reference Correction Based Approach|In this paper, the problem of formation control is studied for second-order multi-agent systems with practical issues like mismatched uncertainties and obstacle avoidance. A reference correction algorithm based sliding mode control scheme is proposed to ensure the boundedness of each agent';s position tracking error. Both disturbance observer and artificial potential field are implemented to first tackle the problem of obstacle avoidance with the existence of mismatched uncertainties. The unreachable reference scenarios are then defined to describe the passive correcting behaviours of the multi-agent system when agents are trying to avoid obstacles. A distributed reference correction algorithm is developed for each agent to attenuate the harmful effects of passive correcting behaviours. The effectiveness of obstacle avoidance and boundedness of position tracking error are both verified by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, multi-robot system based numerical simulations and comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and controller.

This article focuses on the conceptualization of a multi-projects governance system. The projects are supposed to be distributed with as many local and autonomous decision makers as the projects. The proposed model is based on reactive agent architecture. The main idea of this model is to enhance communication and cooperation between different project actors and respond to the constraints and fluctuations occurring in the management of transformation projects especially the strategic alignment. The essential feature that distinguishes our proposition from models previously defined in the literature is an articulation of information technology, artificial intelligence and best practices for the good governance of organizational transformation projects.

Belkacemi|Experimental implementation of Multi-Agent System Algorithm to prevent Cascading Failure after N-1-1 contingency in smart grid systems|Cascading Failure and Blackout Event is one of the major concerns to all in the Power System industry. Recent literature mainly focused on predicting the occurrence of this catastrophic event and suggestions on ways to curtail the spread of Cascading Failure. No research, to our knowledge, as focused on preventing Cascading Failure without the use of high cost precautionary steps. This work utilizes an adaptive Multi-Agent System Algorithm in a smart grid system with two-way communication capability to successfully prevent Cascading Failure and Blackout Event after N-1-1 transmission line contingency condition with more than one transmission line overloaded. The proposed algorithm stops the cascading failure after the N-1-1 contingency by redispatching the power from the generators through the use of pre-stated mathematical combinations and the consideration of necessary constraints and factors. We obtained experimental results instead of the popular simulation results that has been the norm for publications on Cascading Failures and Blackout Event. The generation and transmission side of IEEE 30-bus system was used as the experimental test bed. It was ascertained that the test bed can experience a Cascading Failure and Blackout Event if no preventive measure was taken. We then utilized the algorithm to prevent Cascading Failure. The experimental results affirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

The comparing result show that the method based on MAS and DBN has a better performance than others.

33|6215022|Journal Article|2013|Shreyas Sundaram|Structural Controllability and Observability of Linear Systems Over Finite Fields With Applications to Multi-Agent Systems|We develop a graph-theoretic characterization of controllability and observability of linear systems over finite fields. Specifically, we show that a linear system will be structurally controllable and observable over a finite field if the graph of the system satisfies certain properties, and the size of the field is sufficiently large. We also provide graph-theoretic upper bounds on the controllability and observability indices for structured linear systems (over arbitrary fields). We then use our analysis to design nearest-neighbor rules for multi-agent systems where the state of each agent is constrained to lie in a finite set. We view the discrete states of each agent as elements of a finite field, and employ a linear iterative strategy whereby at each time-step, each agent updates its state to be a linear combination (over the finite field) of its own state and the states of its neighbors. Using our results on structural controllability and observability, we show how a set of leader agents can use this strategy to place all agents into any desired state (within the finite set), and how a set of sink agents can recover the set of initial values held by all of the agents.

The control input of the leader agent is nonzero and not available to any follower agent. We first consider a class of high order chain integrator-type multi-agent systems. By employing the robust integral of the sign of the error technique, a continuous distributed control law is constructed using local information obtained from neighboring agents. Using Lyapunov analysis theory, we show that under a connected undirected information communication topology, the proposed protocol achieves semiglobal leader-following consensus. We then extend the approach to a class of more general uncertain multiagent systems. A numerical example is given to verify our proposed protocol.

33|8027916|Conference Paper|2017|Xinghong Zhang|Decentralized adaptive control of a class of discrete-time nonlinear hidden-leader follower multi-agent systems|In this paper, decentralized adaptive control is investigated for a class of discrete-time nonlinear hidden leader-follower multi-agent systems. Different from the conventional leader-follower multi-agent system, among all the agents, there exists a hidden leader that knows the desired reference trajectory, while the follower agents know neither the desired reference signal nor who is a leader. The dynamics of each agent is described by the nonlinear discrete-time auto-regressive model with unknown parameters, and each agent is intrinsically nonlinearly coupled with its neighbors through history information. In order to deal with the uncertainties and nonlinearity, a projection algorithm is applied to identify parameters. Based on the certainty equivalence principle in adaptive control theory, the control law for the hidden leader agent is designed to track the desired reference signal, and the local control law for each follower agent is designed using neighborhood history information. Under the decentralized adaptive control, the hidden leader agent is shown to track the desired reference signal successfully, all the follower agents follow the hidden leader agent, and the closed-loop system eventually achieves strong synchronization under uncertain strong couplings. In the end, the simulation results show the validity of the proposed scheme of decentralized adaptive control.

34|1234824|Conference Paper|2002|M.R. Ahmad|Development of decentralized based reactive control strategy for intelligent multi-agent mobile robotics system|Multi-agent system is one of the most popular research interests in robotics nowadays. How would collections of simple robots aid us in human endeavours? Let us think about an ant colony. Ants have little capability, but when many of them are working together, they can do incredible tasks. By examining the major control architectures available in robotics area, decentralized-based reactive control architecture gives the tools required. Priority-based scheme is used in arbitration level to select which behaviour to run. It does not need to gather all information from various sensors to plan its action like deliberative control, which is also known as sensors fusion that clearly required a lot of computational time. Besides that, the mapping that the deliberate control architecture produces might not be valid at the time when changes occur between the time it gathers the information and the time it plans its actions. Instead, intelligence will arise when these simple agents work together to perform some complex task cooperatively. Our multi-agent system consists of three mobile robots that are required to transfer a large object through a restricted area. We are using a leader follower strategy to accomplish this task. Intelligence in multi-agent system in our context is that any agents have a possibility to be a leader or a follower depending on current situation of the environment. This means that all agents are homogeneously equal in hardware and software. By having this capability, it will ensure the burden of the programming task will be decreased because there will be only one program needed for the whole system. In this paper, decentralized reactive control architecture is used to develop an intelligent multi-agent cooperative strategy to perform complex task like carrying a load and navigation.
34|9405623|Journal Article|2021|Rui Wang|Distributed Time-Varying Output Formation Tracking Control for General Linear Multi-Agent Systems With Multiple Leaders and Relative Output-Feedback|In this paper, a unified distributed swarm intelligence algorithm is developed to study time-varying output formation (TVOF) for a general linear multi-agent system (MAS) with a directed network. New adaptive output-feedback formation protocols are proposed to achieve TVOF stabilization for leaderless directed networks and TVOF tracking for leader-follower networks. For the leaderless case, only agents'; outputs are required to achieve the desired time-varying formation. An adaptive observer-type formation protocol is constructed via relative outputs of neighboring agents. No global information of the directed network is used to determine the protocol. A distributed algorithm is developed to solve the TVOF stabilization problem after the observability decomposition. For the leader-follower case, only partial agents have knowledge of the leaders'; information. An adaptive formation tracking protocol is constructed using dynamic relative output-feedback for neighboring followers. Based on the distributed algorithm, it is proved that the TVOF tracking problem with multiple leaders can be solved in a fully distributed manner.

Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.

Alvarez-Munoz|Time-delay Tolerant Control of an Omnidirectional Multi-agent System for Transport Operations|This paper proposes a solution regarding the general consensus of a multi-agent time-delay system in order to achieve interactive and transport operations. The multi-agent system consists of a set of omni directional mobile robots equipped with vision based systems and interactive tools. It is well known that the vision-based systems and the communication between agents produce time-delays, causing stability issues for consensus and formation control. The present work deals with a high precision consensus by means of a time-delay tolerant control law. First, the mathematical model of every agent is presented. Then, this dynamic model is extended to the set of robots conforming the multi-agent system. After that, a control law, consisting of a time-delay tolerant strategy allows orientation and position consensus. The formulation of a simple algorithm for orientation and position formations for the set of robots is presented. Finally, simulation results validate the proposed control strategy and compare the results when time-delay is present in the system or not for an object transport scenario.

Verginis|Closed-Form Barrier Functions for Multi-Agent Ellipsoidal Systems With Uncertain Lagrangian Dynamics|In this letter, we design a decentralized control protocol for the collision avoidance of a multi-agent system, which is composed of 3-D ellipsoidal agents that obey second-order uncertain Lagrangian dynamics. More specifically, we derive a novel closed-form smooth barrier function that resembles a distance metric between 3-D ellipsoids and can be used by feedback-based control laws to guarantee inter-agent collision avoidance. Discontinuities and adaptation laws are incorporated in the control protocol to deal with the uncertainties of the dynamic model. The control laws are decentralized, in the sense that each agent uses only local sensing information. Simulation results verify the theoretical findings.
34|7491322|Journal Article|2018|Dinh Hoa Nguyen|Minimum-Rank Dynamic Output Consensus Design for Heterogeneous Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems|In this paper, we propose a new and systematic design framework for output consensus in heterogeneous multiinput multi-output (MIMO) general nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) subjected to directed communication topology. First, the input-output feedback linearization method is utilized assuming that the internal dynamics is input-to-state stable (ISS) to obtain linearized subsystems of agents. Consequently, we propose local dynamic controllers for agents such that the linearized subsystems have an identical closed-loop dynamics which has a single pole at the origin whereas other poles are on the open left-half complex plane. This allows us to deal with distinct agents having arbitrarily vector relative degrees and to derive rank-1 cooperative control inputs for those homogeneous linearized dynamics which results in a minimum rank distributed dynamic consensus controller for the initial nonlinear MAS. Moreover, we prove that the coupling strength in the consensus protocol can be arbitrarily small but positive and, hence, our consensus design is nonconservative. Next, our design approach is further strengthened by tackling the problem of randomly switching communication topologies among agents where we relax the assumption on the balance of each switched graph and derive a distributed rank-1 dynamic consensus controller. Finally, a numerical example is introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
34|7462250|Journal Article|2017|Wenwu Yu|Observer Design for Tracking Consensus in Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems: Fractional Order Less Than Two|This technical note studies the leader-following tracking consensus problem of a class of multi-agent systems where the dynamics of the leader is described by second-order systems. In order to track the states of the leader, observers for the followers are designed by fractional-order multi-agent systems where the relative velocity information is unavailable. It is interestingly found that the followers can track the leader with second-order dynamics even if the fractional order is less than two by only using the position information of the local neighbors, which is different from the existing results. A novel fractional-order observer is first proposed, whose order is surprisingly less than the original leader system. It is also shown that leader-following consensus can be ensured if some carefully selected followers are informed and the relative position-based protocols are appropriately designed with fractional order being between one and two. A necessary and sufficient condition for the leader-following consensus in multi-agent systems without control-input delay is proposed. The results are then extended to the case with constant control-input delay. It is found that, in both cases, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the augmented Laplacian matrix of the topology play an important role in achieving consensus.

This paper reports on the use of multi-agent system technology to automate the management and analysis of SCADA and digital fault recorder (DFR) data. The multi-agent system, entitled protection engineering diagnostic agents (PEDA), integrates legacy intelligent systems that analyze SCADA and DFR data to provide data management and online diagnostic information to protection engineers.

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent simulation method to evaluate policies based on complex adaptive system theory. Furthermore, we propose a semiotic EDA (Epistemic, Deontic, Axiological) agent model to simulate agent';s behavior in the system by incorporating the social norms reflecting the policy. A case study is also provided to validate our approach. Our research present better adaptability and validity than the qualitative analysis and experiment approach and the semiotic agent model provides high creditability to simulate agents'; behavior.
34|8126168|Conference Paper|2017|B.K. Swathi Prasad|Goal-based multi-agent tree formation using reinforcement learning|Self - organizing natural systems are inspirational to swarm robotics. The applications include social insect systems and social behaviours. The multi - agent tree formation is one of the communication topologies of swarm robotic system. The agents are linked in a tree to communicate with each other through the hierarchy. The focus of this work is to form tree using Transfer Learning (TL) of Reinforcement Learning (RL). The goal of the approach is to maintain a certain distance with each agent. Here six agents form a tree, one among them is the leader. Each agent interacts with leader and others in the mission space till the policy of distance constraint is satisfied. The convergence of cost error is used as a paradigm to measure the knowledge transfer. Once the transfer of knowledge has taken place, the error approaches zero after two episodes and remain constant throughout the horizon. The novelty of the approach is to provide a distinct advantage when target information is unknown and only state information is known.

The Internet of Things and the so called Industry 4.0 accompanied by their definition of architecture on the one hand and multi-agent systems with their decentralized system structure to handle complex tasks and adapting to changing conditions on the other hand are not matched as of yet. Furthermore, the human worker is not yet an integrated part of these kinds of systems and may be overstrained by the vast amount of information resulting from more and more digitally available information. This paper proposes a strategy to integrate methods and architecture of IoT with cyber-physical systems and multi-agent systems. It elaborates on the processing of data and environmental conditions to provide the human worker with context-based information reduction which helps to minimize the information overload. Two use cases in the field of intralogistics which make use of the new concept are presented.

35|9403586|Conference Paper|2021|Yousof barzegari|Consensus of First Order Multi-agent Systems with Actuator or dynamic Fault by weighted adjacency matrix approach (WAMA)|In this paper, the consensus problem for the first-order discrete-time multi-agent systems (MASs) In the presence of fault is studied. This study uses two concepts of watchdog model-based observer and weighted adjacency matrix approach (WAMA). The purpose of this study is to reach a consensus on MASs when one or more agents have been damaged. In this method, for any agent, a watchdog that measures the amount of difference between the states of the actual system and the calculated states of the system by the agent';s model is designed, this generated residual declares the amount of agents deviation. A decision function is used to decide how this malfunctioning affects the neighboring agents. Therefore, the states that each agent transmits to the neighboring agents are augmented by the output of the decision function. By increasing states matrix dimensions, each agent will report its health status or commanding by using a new state to the neighboring agents. This additional state is affected by a decision function that expresses the neighboring agents how should behave with this malfunction agent. Finally, the produced residue will be weight of the adjacency matrix and will cause to correct consensus. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.

Gomez-Gualdron|Self-Reconfigurable Electric Power Distribution System using Multi-Agent Systems|Electric power distribution systems (EPDS) can be found almost everywhere, from ship power systems to data centers. In many critical applications, there is needed to maintain minimal operating capability under fault conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to develop energy distribution control techniques, which allow the implementation of a self-reconfigurable EPDS. This research project focuses on the application of multi agent systems (MAS) to develop a self-reconfigurable EPDS. MAS are composed of multiple interacting software elements, known as agents. An agent is an abstraction that describes autonomous software that &#034;acts on behalf of a user or another program. A prototype of a MAS is proposed to reconfigure an electric system in order to maximize the number of served loads with highest priority. We used a shipboard simulation test system based on a zonal architecture. The test system is simulated using Matlabtrade Simulinktrade -SimPowerSystems toolbox, and the MAS was implemented using Javatrade programming language and JADE platform.

35|6896829|Conference Paper|2014|Xiaoling Wang|Consensus of edge dynamics on directed multi-agent systems|Consensus in multi-agent systems means that reach an agreement among states of the whole group. However, almost all the existed works on consensus have been in the description of the states of nodes, and fewer efforts have been devoted to the consensus taking place on the edges of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we focus on the dynamics proceed on the edges and establish a discrete-time and a continuous-time edge consensus protocols respectively for directed multi-agent systems. By mapping the edge topology to its line graph of the original nodal topology, we analyze the consensus of the edge protocols rigorously, and get that both the discrete-time protocol and the continuous-time protocol of directed multi-agent systems can guarantee that an edge consensus is asymptotically reached for all initial states when the original directed system is strongly connected. Numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of both the discrete-time and the continuous-time models.

Instead of balancing the load in cluster by process migration, or by moving an entire process to a less loaded computer, we make an attempt to balance load by splitting processes into separate jobs and then balance them among nodes. In order to get target, we use mobile agent (MA) to distribute load among nodes in a cluster. In this paper, distributed dynamic load balancing using MA (DDLBMA) technique is presented. We introduce types of agents needed to meet the requirements of the proposed load balancing. Different metrics are used to compare load balancing mechanism with the existing technology. The experiment is carried out on cluster of PC';s divided into multiple local area network (LAN) using mobile agent system PMADE (Platform for Mobile agent distribution and execution).

The agent decision model in this paper tries to get a balance between efficiency and flexibility in the specification of the agent behavior in simple and complex situations. This is applied in a simulation framework for indoor scenarios, although it could be extended to other settings.

Robotic soccer is a multi-agent system in which agents play in real-time, dynamic, complex and noisy environment. Many parameters affect the result of shooting toward the goal and agents must response to variations in soccer field rapidly. Therefore it is impossible to use all features in scoring behavior. This paper selects dataset for effective features of scoring behavior simulated soccer agents, then compares the size of the trees and accuracy produced by each feature selection scheme against the size of the trees and accuracy produced by C4.5 with no feature selection method. Experimental results have shown that dimensionality reductions lead to operate faster and more effective learning algorithm in real-time simulated soccer agent.

36|9177638|Conference Paper|2020|F. Baghbani|Cooperative Adaptive Fuzzy Control of Uncertain Affine Nonlinear Multi-agent Systems Based on Artificial Potential Functions|Cooperative control of multi-agent systems deals with various challenges such as uncertain dynamics, external disturbances, and limitations on interactions with other agents or the leader. Here, a cooperative adaptive fuzzy controller is introduced for a class of higher-order affine nonlinear multi-agent systems. The agents can only interact with their neighbors, and only a portion of them have access to the leader states. The unknown dynamics of the agents are approximated by fuzzy systems. In addition, the artificial potential functions (APFs) are employed to model the interaction among the agents. The APFs could provide a more transparent and straightforward design in comparison with usual graph-based methods. By modifying the error function, the proposed controller extends our previous work by giving only a portion of the agents access to the leader states. Lyapunov stability theory is used to design appropriate update laws for the weights of the fuzzy system and verify the overall stability of the system. Simulations results indicate a lower steady- state tracking error and lesser control energy consumption compared with a competing neural network-based approach.

An aperiodic sampled-data based protocol is induced by using neighboring information with uncertainly time-varying sampling intervals. With the obtained protocol and properties of Laplacian matrix, the containment control problem of continuous-time multi-agent systems is equivalently transformed into a stability problem of discrete-time systems. By fixing a sampling length in the given range, a time-invariant discrete-time system is obtained. Then the systems with variation of sampling intervals can be considered as uncertain systems of the time-invariant discrete-time system. By using small-gain theorem, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee stability of uncertain discrete-time systems. The theoretical results are illustrated by some simulations.

Jardim|Dynamic security assessment: system architecture based on multi-agent systems|The basic requirements for an online dynamic security assessment (DSA) system are robustness (consistent and accurate results), fast response and flexibility. The specification of how much accuracy, flexibility and performance is required depends on factors such as levels of network stress, operating procedures, reliability standards, and regulatory/economical constraints to be determined for each particular power system. Usually there are reliability and economic reasons for improved security assessment. This paper shows the functional requirements for the various components of such an architecture. One of key aspects of the development is in the classification of the knowledge and rules for each component.

However, industrial processes should be mostly emulated while agent-based solutions are integrating with CPPS since it is not always possible to apply cyber-based solutions to these systems directly. The target system can be miniaturised while sustaining its functionality. Hence, in this paper, we introduce an agent-based industrial production line and discuss the system development using Lego technology while providing integration of software agents as well as focusing on low-level requirements. In this way, a CPPS is emulated while agents control the system.
36|7810984|Conference Paper|2016|Jiaqi Yao|An efficient approach for rule matching in production system based on multi-agent|Production system, which is also named as rule engine, has been widely used in artificial intelligence. Rete algorithm is the most popular rule-match algorithm, which speeds up the whole procedure by sharing the conditions among the productions and storing the temporary results. However, when the size of rules and facts continues to grow, Rete algorithm becomes computationally expensive and slow. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for rule matching in production system based on Multi-Agent, which treats each node in rete algorithm as an agent, and every agent individually performs its own computational tasks and shares the state by passing messages. We also introduce indexes on tokens to accelerate the match and design a mechanism to balance the computational tasks among agents. Finally we conduct experiment to show its efficiency.

By some similar transformation and the augment of the output matrix, the consensus of the multi-agent systems based on the agents'; output can be transformed into the constrained stability of some systems based on the system state. Consensus problem can then be cast into the feasibility of a series of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs) with the complex eigenvalue as the coefficient, which can be converted to the real coefficient linear matrix inequalities through the equivalence of some matrix inequalities. This method is also applied to tracking a reference state. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Firstly, for the directed topological structure among the followers, a distributed adaptive observer is designed to estimate the whole states of all the leaders under the influences of the leaders'; unknown inputs. By utilizing Hardy';s inequality and common Lyapunov theory, the finite-time convergence of the proposed observer is proved. On the basis of this conclusion, a predefined distributed containment control protocol including the desired convex combinations of the leaders is developed for each follower by using the given weights. Then an algorithm is proposed to design the control parameters in the proposed containment control protocol. With the help of the output regulation theory, the finite-time output containment criterion for nonlinear multi-agent systems in the presence of the leaders'; unknown inputs is derived. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
36|4518983|Conference Paper|2008|Nil Kilicay-Ergin|Executable Modeling for System of Systems Architecting: An Artificial Life Framework|There is a diversity of frameworks and methodologies for enabling architecture developments. Static representation frameworks provide a standardized way to communicate the architecture to stakeholders, but do not provide means to analyze the system states and system behavior. Therefore, there is a need to convert static representation frameworks to executable models. The aim of this paper is to present Artificial Life approaches as a methodology for understanding behavior of System of Systems. For this, an Artificial Life based framework for modeling System of Systems is presented. The framework comprises cognitive architectures embedded in multi-agent models.

Gull|Agent based Assistance System with Ubiquitous Data Mining for road safety|The number of accidents caused every year in India is disastrously high 95% of these are attributed to drivers'; errors. Risk assessment is at the core of the road safety problem. This paper presents an advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), called ABASUR, that analyses situational driver behavior and proposes real-time countermeasures to minimize fatalities/casualties. The system is based on ubiquitous data mining (UDM) concepts. It fuses and analyses different types of information from crash data and physiological sensors to diagnose driving risks in real time. The novelty of our approach consists of augmenting the diagnosis through UDM with associated countermeasures based on a context awareness mechanism. In other words, our system diagnoses and chooses a countermeasure by taking into account the contextual situation of the driver and the road conditions. The types of context we exploit include vehicle dynamics, drivers'; physiological condition, driver';s profile and environmental conditions. The system, thus aims at proposing an innovative, intelligent system which aids the drivers take a proper decision to pre-decide their next move, hence reducing drastically the probability of many road accidents.

A local information-based distributed protocol is designed by utilizing the instantaneous states of the agent itself and the delayed states of its neighbors. Through model transformation and stability analysis, an explicit mathematical description of a feasible time-varying formation set is proposed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the systems with switching topologies and nonuniform communication delays to achieve the feasible time-varying formation are obtained. The coupling constraints on the gain parameters and sampling period are proposed, so as to guide the design of parameters in the protocol. We include the effects of velocity tracking error damping gain in the protocol and derive milder conditions which allow for not only bounded nonuniform communication delays but also for dynamically switching directed graphs that are jointly connected. The numerical examples are further presented to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the obtained results.

Etani|Robot media communication: an interactive real-world guide agent|Describes a guide system and the software architecture for an autonomous, interactive robot based on a multi-agent system. A robot navigation system has been developed allowing the robot to guide people through halls in various types of exhibitions. Our approach uses an infrared location system in the hallway ceilings, making the environment part of a sensor-distributed robot system. The real-world guide agent is composed of a guide agent on a hand-held mobile computer and a robot agent on an autonomous mobile robot.

The virtual space is generated from computer data using shared space technology and it creates a distributed intelligence in order to manage the communication and control the guide in a laboratory. We have experimented with and verified this software architecture using a prototype autonomous mobile robot equipped with a compass.

And we give the theorems that the output of each agent tracks the average value of history outputs of its neighbor agents, and the closed-loop system eventually achieves strong synchronization. Finally, the simulation is provided to illustrated the validity of the results.
36|5952430|Conference Paper|2011|Aarti Singh|Adaptive and automated fault-tolerance for multi-agent systems|Fault tolerance in MASs is usually implemented with dynamic replication strategy, which demands real time replication of all agents. This adds to unnecessary replicas, more cost and also increases system complexity. Therefore the challenge of balanced replication is still prevailing. The major thrust of this work is to overcome the mentioned challenge and hence provide an equilibrium between active and passive replication of agents. The proposed framework relies on the fact that only critical agents need to be replicated, wherein criticality of an agent is assessed on the basis of its cardinality. The proposed framework has been implemented in JADE and provides promising results. The solution proposed adapts well to the transient environment situations of the agents and provides fault tolerance by making optimum utilization of the system resources.

Regulating structures should be represented explicitly and independently from the acting components at different levels of abstraction in order for stakeholders to be able to analyze the overall setup and decide on their participation. This paper proposes a framework for describing collaboration relationships in inter-organizational partnerships. The framework is based on the OperA model for multi-agent organizations and provides a specification dimension which describes what to do from the designer';s perspective based on the concept of organization, role and role dependency, and an enactment dimension which represents the agents and their role enacting relationships to describe who does what from an implementation perspective. The adoption of composite roles and composite agents facilitates a modeling of nested organizations, which offers a suitable way to manage/regulate inter-organizational interactions.

37|7397307|Conference Paper|2015|Marx Viana|The Development of Normative Autonomous Agents: An Approach|Open multi-agent systems (MASs) act as societies in which autonomous and heterogeneous agents can work towards similar or different goals. In order to cope with the heterogeneity, autonomy and diversity of interests among the different agents in the society, open MASs establish a set of behavioral norms that is used as a mechanism to ensure a state of cooperation among agents. Such norms regulate the behavior of the agents by defining obligations, permissions and prohibitions. Fulfillment of a norm may be encouraged through a reward while violation of a norm may be discouraged through punishment. Although norms are promising mechanisms to regulate an agent';s behavior, we should note that each agent is an autonomous entity that is free to fulfill or violate each associated norm. Thus, agents can use different strategies when deciding to achieve their goals including whether to comply with their associated norms. Agents might choose to achieve their goals while ignoring their norms, thus overlooking the rewards or punishments they may receive. In contrast agents may choose to comply with all the norms although some of their goals may not be achieved. In this context, this paper proposes a framework for simulation of normative agents providing a basis for understanding the impacts of norms on agents.

Also the multi-agent system is guaranteed an almost sure stability by determining the control input update timing by the triggering condition which is based on Lyapunov';s stability theorem. Finally we verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by numerical simulation.

37|7260819|Conference Paper|2015|Zou Delong|A class of tracking problem for multi-agent systems with time delays|In this paper, a class of tracking problem for multi-agent systems with both switching topology and time varying delays is investigated. Specially, we consider the agents'; distribution, which agents are randomly deployed into the 2-dimensional space. With the assistance of Voronoi diagrams, this space is divided into many Voronoi cells. During the pursuit process, when a target enters a new Voronoi cell, the Voronoi site agent becomes a tracking agent. This means that not only the topology but also the tracking agents switch, which is significantly different from the traditional switching topologies. The controller of tracking agents is designed for both switching topology and time varying delays. Finally, the proposed tracking strategy is verified by a set of simulations.

To this end, the proposed system is designed with three-module configurations: environmental perception, task planning, and motion planning. The environmental perception module utilizes a vision sensor to recognize all objects placed on the workspace and extract their unique ID, size, and pose. The task planning module divides a given task into primitive skill levels and distributes each primitive skill to the associated robotic manipulator with the relevant object information in a systematic manner for robotic manipulators not to collide with each other. The motion planning module determines the motion of a robotic arm and a robotic hand by solving inverse kinematics for the robotic arm and by opening or closing two fingers. The proposed system has been tested and verified in real robot environments through a complex task &#034;peg in hole&#034; that requires at least two robotic manipulators.

Each agent moves with the same constant absolute velocity whose direction is updated according to the agents in his sensing neighbourhood. If the distance between a susceptible agent and an infected one is less than a given contacting radius, then the agents are considered in contacts for the spreading of infections of epidemics with the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. We propose a control strategy that each moving susceptible agent avoids the infected agents in his sensing neighbourhood. The simulation results show that the strategy can enhance the epidemic threshold and is validated for spreading control.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve these problems. The agent uses a rule set to conduct its behavior. Our system consists of reinforcement learning with an Action Selection Priority Level (ASPL) module and a generalized rules module. Using the ASPL, the reinforcement learning module chooses a proper cooperative behavior while the generalized rule module can accelerate the learning process. By applying the proposed method to robot soccer, the learning process can be accelerated by reducing the search space. The results of simulation and real experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The same relay has multi settings that need to change accordingly with the mode of operation. The main reason for the challenge is the continuous change in the operations of the Distributed Generations. In order to increase the resiliency of the system, a co-simulation platform based on multiagent system and a battery are connected to the microgrid system.

To ensure that the followers can reach the convex hull spanned by leaders under the influence of disturbances, the non-smooth control strategy is introduced. The developed protocol is applied to a specific multi-agent system to show its effectiveness.

By using the partial information of an objective function, the design aims to steer the outputs of the agents to an agreement on the optimal solution to the objective function. To solve this problem, this paper introduces distributed coordinators to calculate the desired outputs, and designs reference-tracking controllers for the agents to follow the desired outputs. To deal with the nonlinear uncertain dynamics, the closed-loop multi-agent system is considered as a dynamical network, and Sontag';s input-to-state stability (ISS) is employed to characterize the interconnections. It is shown that output agreement in multi-agent nonlinear systems is achievable by means of distributed optimal controllers via a small-gain approach. The proposed design features a three-layer architecture, and the reference-tracking controllers can be implemented as successive nonlinear proportional-integral (PI) loops. A numerical example is employed to show the effectiveness of the design.

Finite time consensus can reach consensus faster and have better disturbance rejection properties compared with conventional asymptotic consensus. Hence, we propose a distributed, independent and asynchronous event-triggered control protocol with leaders. We demonstrate that each follower agent can achieve consensus to the convex hull spanned by the leaders'; agents in a certain time regardless of the initial condition under this event-triggered control strategy.
38|9497472|Conference Paper|2021|Erin Lanus|Test and Evaluation Framework for Multi-Agent Systems of Autonomous Intelligent Agents|Test and evaluation is a necessary process for ensuring that engineered systems perform as intended under a variety of conditions, both expected and unexpected. In this work, we consider the unique challenges of developing a unifying test and evaluation framework for complex ensembles of cyber-physical systems with embedded artificial intelligence. We propose a framework that incorporates test and evaluation throughout not only the development life cycle, but continues into operation as the system learns and adapts in a noisy, changing, and contended environment. The framework accounts for the challenges of testing the integration of diverse systems at various hierarchical scales of composition while respecting that testing time and resources are limited. A generic use case is provided for illustrative purposes. Research directions emerging as a result of exploring the use case via the framework are suggested.

Gmytrasiewicz|Using decision theory to formalize emotions in multi-agent systems|We use the formalism of decision theory to develop principled definitions of emotional states of a rational agent. We postulate that these notions are useful for rational agent design. First, they can serve as internal states controlling the allocation of computations and time devoted to cognitive tasks under external pressures. Second, they provide a well defined implementation-independent vocabulary the agents can use to communicate their internal states to each other. Finally, they are essential during interactions with human agents in open multi-agent environments. Our approach provides a formal bridge between the rich bodies of work in cognitive science and the high-end AI architectures for designing rational artificial agents.

We consider a grid connected solar micro-grid which contains two solar Photo Voltaic (PV) systems each contains a local consumer, a solar PV system and a battery. First we calculate the load patterns and solar power generated in the two solar units. Then we use Multi Agent System based distributed energy management of solar micro-grid with smart grid frame work. We develop a simulation model in Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) for dynamic model which considers the intermittent nature of solar power, randomness of load, dynamic pricing of grid and variation of critical loads and choose the best possible action every hour to stabilize and optimize the solar micro-grid. Further more, MAS increases the operational efficiency and thereby maximizes the power production of solar micro-grid and minimizes the operational cost. Thus MAS in micro-grid leads to economic and environmental optimization. Simulated operation of solar generators and loads are studied by performing simulations under different agent objectives. Outcome of the simulation studies demonstrates the effectiveness of proposed MAS in distributed energy management of micro-grid.

38|1547133|Conference Paper|2005|Dong Liu|A Multi-Agent Based Approach for Modeling and Simulation of Bulk Power System Restoration|A Multi-Agent System(MAS) based approach for modeling and simulation of power system restoration is presented in this paper. The power system restoration process is represented as a multi-agent system with hierar chical architecture. Two major kinds of agents are in cluded, which are management agent(MGAG) and practical components in power system(PCAG). PCAG includes three types of agents: Generator Agent (GAG), Substation Agent(SAG) and Load Agent(LAG). When a subsystem with necessary components such as GAGs, SAGs and LAGs is built up, one MGAG is generated to in charge of the subsystem and provides negotiations between different PCAGs and with other subsystems. Each agent is granted with its own knowledge base, database and decision sup port base. In order to figure out a feasible restoration plan, a distributed computing structure is proposed. The compu tation tasks such as constraints check of operations and path search for power transmission are assigned to every agent in the MAS. Both decentralized control and central ized control are employed in this model to make up for the disadvantages of each control method. A sample simulation in a MAS platform is provided to demonstrate the validity of this model.
38|9599467|Early Access Article|2021|Domenico Cappello|Distributed Differential Games for Control of Multi-Agent Systems|Motivated by the challenges arising in the field of multi-agent systems (MAS) control, we consider linear heterogenous MAS subject to local communication and investigate the problem of designing distributed controllers for such systems. We provide a game theoretic framework for systematically designing distributed controllers, taking into account individual objectives of the agents and their possibly incomplete knowledge of the MAS. Linear state-feedback control laws are obtained via the introduction of a distributed differential game, namely the combination of local non-cooperative differential games, which are solved in a decentralised fashion. Conditions for stability of the MAS are provided for the special cases of acyclic and strongly connected communication graph topologies. These results are then exploited to provide stability conditions for general graph topologies. The proposed framework is demonstrated on a tracking synchronisation problem associated with the design of a distributed secondary voltage controller for microgrids and on a numerical example.

In order to avoid such deception, a multi-agent system must be designed to test the confidence of agents. In this paper, we present a new approach to agent-based confidence modeling. This approach integrates two confidence requirements, namely, trust and certainty. We use fuzzy logic in representing the importance of trust and certainty to model an agent';s confidence reasoning. The modeling mechanism eliminates the influence of untrusted agents'; opinions because certainty level and importance of trust may not be valuable in all circumstances.

Two fixed-time consensus control protocols for multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics and uncertain disturbances in both leaderless and leader-follower cases are proposed. Compared with the initial-condition-based finite-time consensus, it is theoretically shown that any prescribed convergence time for the achievement of consensus can be guaranteed within fixed time regardless of the initial conditions. Furthermore, the achievement of consensus is shown to be robust against bounded uncertain disturbances affecting the agents. Finally, some simulations are provided to illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The dynamic of each agent is first order with unknown mismatched parameters and external disturbances. To reduce the communication burden between each agent and decrease the update frequency of the controllers, the fixed threshold event-triggered mechanisms are considered during the states';s broadcasting and the control signals. Based on the adaptive method, the event-based cooperative control protocol is constructed. The asymptotically consensus tracking of all agents are guaranteed and the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, meanwhile the Zeno behavior is excluded. Simulation results of four agents show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method.

Kartheeswaran|Multi agent based audio steganography|Today';s Information Technology grows rapidly with new technologies and need more security for the data transmission over the internet. Steganography is one of the solutions to ensure the data secure over the internet. An audio steganography is a method to transfer concealed information by changing the cover audio file without degrading the quality of the original file. The cover medium before steganography and stego medium after steganography should have the same characteristics of a good steganographic system. The Agent technology involves distributing the services with flexible manner. As most of the applications are created as services in present computing scenario and data security also can be served as a service. Agent-based steganography will improve the efficiency of the secure steganographic system and it will be more convenient in terms of flexibility and availability. In this research paper, we present a trusted communication platform for multi-agents that are able to hide the confidential message in the cover audio stream according to the user request and retrieve the hidden information from the stego audio file. This system provides high availability and flexibility in this context and a more feasible way to trust the message transmission. This work is currently being done and designing part of this work has been done successfully with satisfied results.

In this study, network-induced effects, time delay, and change in CT have been addressed to examine the system performance in a closed loop. An event-triggered control method is used to reduce the communication burden in a network. An intelligent controller based on reinforcement learning consists of two levels, estimator agent and controller agent, in each multi-area system. Particle swarm optimization is used to tune the controller parameters. Furthermore, the proposed control strategy and system architecture as MAS for LFC in SG are analyzed in detail, verified for various load conditions and different network configurations. In addition, mean-square error of the power system states with CT is also analyzed. The results of this study validate the feasibility of the proposed control, as well as the capability of the MAS for the operation of LFC in SG with changes in CT.

Observing from these developed MAS that show great achievements, we could have the following realizations: A lot of design efforts have to be paid varying from communication and cooperation to configuration between agents. Such efforts are often in common with respect to the ideas or methodologies. Such efforts are also becoming ';entrance barrier'; of the development of MAS for general system developers.

The interaction of several simple agents leads to a dynamic system allowing efficient approximation of a solution. It is shown from simulation results that this method is able to obtain sub-optimal target configurations which are the same as ones obtained by a mathematical programming approach.

-type ILC protocol with the rectifying action is proposed. By improving the existing average operator and choosing the suitable variables, the leaderfollowing FOMASs under the proposed protocol are rewritten as a two-dimensional (2D) dynamical model. Based on the 2D analysis approach, the sufficient conditions are presented for the consensus of FOMASs. It is shown that due to the improved average operator, the derived sufficient conditions are more relaxed. With the increase of iteration step, the output of each follower agent will converge, and as the iteration step goes to infinity, and the limit output of each follower agent can be formulated in terms of the output of leader agent, the mean values of the initial output tracking errors, the learning gain matrices, the fractional order and the structure of communication graph. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

On one hand, they can try kinds of strategies to increase their profit. On the other hand, the competition is also severely concerned by the system operators. It can improve the market efficiency and reduce the generation cost in general. But it can also result in market power and risks. Researchers have studied the topic about the competition with classic economic theory. In this paper, we propose the multi-agent model to study the competition in the day-ahead market. Each agent tries to improve the strategy with reinforcement learning. The demand side bidding makes the market clearing more flexible and complicated. The simulation has provided an example of the multi-agent competition. The result indicates that the demand side price can be reduced when the generators compete with each other completely.

While learning from experience seems to positively affect the alliance performance in supply chain, there is a lack of an explicit description on learning mechanism for alliance members. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-dimensional learning mechanism for alliance members in multi-agent supply chains. Intelligent agents with learning abilities are modeled as member firms, in which the learning structures based on reinforcement learning are defined. The validity of such framework is established by simulating an example learning application using the simplified proposed learning mechanism in a supply chain alliance.

The use of precise and unambiguous notation of formal methods is used to accurately describe and reason about the system under consideration at the design time. Multi-agent systems deployed in dynamic and unpredictable environment needs to have the ability of self-adaptation, making them adaptable to the failures. State of the art encourages the use of MAPE-K feedback loop for the provision of self-adaptation in any system. There is a dire need of formal vocabulary that can be used for the conceptual design of any real-time multi-agent system with self-adaptation. In this paper, we have proposed a set of predefined interfaces for the provision of self-adaptation in real-time multi-agent systems. The interfaces are based on monitor, analyze, plan, and execute phases of the MAPE-K feedback loop. We formally specify our interfaces using timed-communicating object-Z language. The complete framework is elaborated using a trivial case-study of conveyor belt system based on a real-time agent architecture.

The agent dynamics is modeled as general linear system attached the Lipschitz-type nonlinear term. Since in reality communications among mobile agents are intermittent, a class of non-continuous observer-type protocol is proposed based on each agent only intermittently sharing relative outputs with neighbors. By virtue of the matrix theory, the switching system theory and the averaging approach, a multi-step protocol design procedure is presented, and the sufficient condition is further derived to ensure the observer-based consensus tracking. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by a numerical example.

Model validation results showed that both accuracy and calculation speed of the new models was much better than the traditional models. So the study of this paper enhanced the intelligent level of mountain traffic management and reduced traffic accidents.

39|1565541|Conference Paper|2005|F. Enembreck|Personalization in multi-agent systems|In this paper we study the aspects of the human-MAS interaction found in organizational applications based on MAS. The increasing number of MAS applications inside organizations introduces a basic problem: how should the user interact with such systems? The problem involves many questions that influence the proper architecture of the MAS and must not only be considered as a fine detail, but should be taken into account from the beginning in the MAS development. Among the most important questions we can stress the interaction modes (multimodal, based on natural language, voice-based, point-and-click interfaces) and the personalization or adaptability of the interaction and the services. From such questions and using our experience in the development of MAS applications for organizations, we present in this article a MAS architecture based on the concept of digital butler. In this architecture, the user interacts with a single assistant agent that can in turn interact with other agents in the system. We use an adaptive assistant agent able to personalize the interaction with the user as well as a set of other adaptive agents able to personalize the execution of the services. Beyond the previous questions, such a distributed architecture offers solutions for the computational aspects found in a MAS, like the complexity and the use of resources.

The ATIS uses an agent-based architecture and multi-objective optimization to answer trip planning requests from multiple users in a co-modal setting, considering vehicle preferences and conflicting criteria. At each set of users'; requests, the transportation network is represented by a co-modal graph that allows decomposing the trip planning problem into smaller tasks: the shortest routes between the network nodes are determined and then combined to obtain possible itineraries.

40|6678776|Journal Article|2014|Weisheng Chen|Adaptive Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems With Unknown Identical Control Directions Based on A Novel Nussbaum-Type Function|This note addresses the adaptive consensus problem of first-order and second-order linearly parameterized multi-agent systems with unknown identical control directions. First, we propose a new Nussbaum-type function based on which a key lemma is established. The lemma plays an important role in analyzing the consensus of the closed-loop multi-agent systems. Second, the Nussbaum-type function is used to design adaptive control laws for first-order and second-order linearly parameterized multi-agent systems so that each agent seeks for the unknown control direction adaptively and cooperatively. Then, under the assumption that the interconnection topology is undirected and connected, it is proved that the first-order and second-order multi-agent systems can achieve consensus by choosing proper design parameters. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control laws.

40|4058886|Conference Paper|2006|Zsolt Kira|Continuous and Embedded Learning for Multi-Agent Systems|This paper describes multi-agent strategies for applying continuous and embedded learning (CEL). In the CEL architecture, an agent maintains a simulator based on its current knowledge of the world and applies a learning algorithm that obtains its performance measure using this simulator. The simulator is updated to reflect changes in the environment or robot state that can be detected by a monitor, such as sensor failures. In this paper, we adapt this architecture to a multi-agent setting in which the monitor is communicated among the team members effectively creating a distributed monitor. The parameters of the current control algorithm (in our case rulebases learned by genetic algorithms) used by all of the agents are added to the monitor as well, allowing for cooperative learning. We show that communication of agent status (e.g. failures) among the team members allows the agents to dynamically adapt to team properties, in this case team size. Furthermore, we show that an agent is able to switch between specializing within a section of the domain when there are many team members and generalizing to other parts of the domain when the rest of the team members are disabled. Finally, we also discuss future potential of this method, most notably in the creation of a distributed case based reasoning system in which the cases are actual genetic algorithm population members that can be swapped among team members
40|8796338|Journal Article|2019|Xingcheng Pu|Weighted Group Consensus for Discrete-Time Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems in the Cooperative-Competitive Network With Time Delays|Group consensus is investigated for a class of discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems which are composed of first-order and second-order agents with communication and input time delays in this paper. Based on the cooperative-competitive relationship between the agents in the system, a novel weighted group consensus protocol is proposed. Some sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the success of group consensus in some special situations by using z-transformation, matrix analysis and algebraic graph theory. The upper bound of time delays can be reckoned by utilizing Gershgorin disk theorem and generalized Nyquist';s criterion. The results show that group consensus has no relationship with communication time delay. Only if the input time delay, the coupling weight between the agents, and the system';s control parameters satisfy the given conditions, the multi-agent systems can realize group consensus. Some simulation results show that the proposed novel protocol can effectively promote the multi-agent systems to achieve weighted group consensus.

The multi-agent system was developed in JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework), a Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) and a compliant open source multi-agent platform. All the six case studies presented in this paper were modeled using JADE. The cases were chosen considering the real life possible scenarios, such as: discharging the battery (boost mode), energy export from the microgrid, charging the battery (buck mode), energy import from diesel generator, energy import from the grid and the system halt. However, considering that the results for the first two cases can demonstrate the performance and features of the proposed MAS, this paper focuses on the results of these cases. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms, necessary for coordinated control and power management, and show the possibility of autonomous built-in operation of a microgrid with a multi-agent system using JADE.

Therefore, it has become more and more difficult to design complex industrial control systems. This paper describes a multi-agent control system for a strip rolling process. In order to realize the distributed and intelligent control of the system, after analyzing the characteristics and structure of this control system, the multi-agent theory was applied and then a control strategy was designed based on multi-agent interaction. Finally, the partition method, the coordination mechanism, and the model structure of the multi-Agent control system for the strip rolling process were analyzed. This paper concludes with a new control structure and system for strip rolling process, which helps to build up the generally integrated model, to eliminate the coupling among control systems, and to realize more intelligent control.

Mostafa|Formulating Situation Awareness for Multi-agent Systems|Improving autonomous agents'; awareness has aroused a great deal of interests in agent research. The objective is to formulate an approach that provides advanced awareness capabilities in the agents'; behaviour. In this paper, we explore the techniques proposed in the literature that have been adopted to enable agents'; awareness which are Active Perception (AP), Situation Awareness (SA) and Context Awareness (CA). In addition, we illustrate the possible integration of the techniques'; core phases with a multi-agent system (MAS). In doing so, we propose an approach to Situation Awareness for a decentralized MAS environment which is abbreviated as SAMAS. The approach assists in the agents'; decision-making process through decomposing the context of an event';s situations. Consequently, the SAMAS approach provides human-based assessments to the agents'; performance. The assessments are fed back to the agents'; to maintain the active perception of their actions. The paper contributes an independent SA approach considered from the perspective of MAS in a dynamic environment.

40|7814572|Conference Paper|2016|Danielli A. Lima|New Bio-Inspired Coordination Strategies for Multi-Agent Systems Applied to Foraging Tasks|Multiple agent systems can be applied to foraging tasks, thus solving this problem in a cooperative approach. The major processes performed by a forager agent are searching and homing. A new coordination searching strategy inspired on Tabu Search is reported here by modifying a previous probabilistic cellular automata ant memory model. Moreover, new homing strategies based on ants behavior and cellular automata are investigated. Combining bio-inspired searching and homing strategies, we propose a new coordination model for foraging in robotics called Hybrid Cellular Automata Ant Queue model, or HCAAQ for short. The model is able to adapt the current system dynamics if either the number of robots or the environment structure change. Experimental simulations were conducted to evaluate different versions of memory policies, resulting in a new homing strategy based on ants communication by inverted pheromone. Besides, simulations confirm that the new homing strategy proposed herein distributes agents equitably between the nests, accelerating the task performance. As a result, using the new team coordination it is possible to avoid lines forming near the nests, specially when the robot number has increased, thus outperforming previous models. The proposed method was implemented in a robotics simulation environment called Webots to better investigate the application of the multi-agent system. Simulation results indicate that the HCAAQ proposed herein could be implemented in multi-robot systems.

When error between estimated and true trajectory become over the threshold, information is transmitted. By using the proposed method, it is expected to reduce the number of information transmission.

During the last two decades, many agent platforms have appeared with the aim of simplifying the development of multi-agent systems. Some of these platforms have been designed for general purposes, while others have been oriented towards specific domains. However, the lack of standards and the complexity associated with supporting such systems, among other difficulties, have hampered their generalised use. This article looks in depth at the current situation of existing agent platforms, trying to analyse their current shortcomings and their expected needs in the near future. The goal of the paper is to identify possible lines of work and some of the most crucial aspects to be considered in order to popularize the application of agent technology as a dynamic and flexible solution to current problems. Moreover, the paper presents SPADE 3, a new version of the SPADE middleware, which has been totally redesigned in order to conform to the identified challenges. Finally, a case study is proposed to illustrate how SPADE 3 is able to fulfill these challenges.

The equivalences between agent in MAS and player in game theory, optimal solution in MAS and equilibrium in game theory, and cooperation task in MAS and multi-stage Markov game were then established. To the difficulties of equilibriums selection, a hawk dove game model, which is a uncorrelated asymmetry game, is build from the point view of evolutionary game theory. And a self-enforcing cooperative algorithm based on replicator dynamic was proposed to find the evolutionary stable strategy of hawk dove game. The simulation verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

41|9295336|Journal Article|2021|Raghavv Goel|Closed-Loop Reference Model Based Distributed Model Reference Adaptive Control for Multi-Agent Systems|This letter confluences ideas from distributed model reference adaptive control (MRAC) architecture for multi-agent systems and closed-loop reference model (CRM) based MRAC algorithm. The concept of CRM is recently proposed in literature for single-agent MRAC problems, where the reference model (leader) gets feedback from the plant (agent/follower) to facilitate improved transient performance. This letter coins the concept of CRM based distributed MRAC, where it is assumed that the leader/reference model is connected only to a subset of followers and incorporates feedback from them in a multi-agent setting. Distributed parameter estimator and controller are designed, which incorporate inter-agent cooperation via communication over a bi-directional graph. The leader state and the time-varying leader input (also known as reference input in MRAC literature) are only accessible to its neighbours. A novel distributed dynamic surface control (DSC)-like strategy is invoked for each follower to cooperatively estimate the unknown reference input required for control design. Simulation results dictate that the proposed closed-loop leader based formulation leads to better transient performance as compared to the status quo and also enables the use of high gain tuners for adaptive update law. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first work which introduces a distributed protocol of CRM-MRAC for multi-agent systems (CRM-DMRAC) with rigorous Lyapunov analysis.

41|9275141|Conference Paper|2020|Yu Ge|Formation tracking for discrete-time multi-agent system with unknown dynamics by using adaptive finite rational orthogonal basis functions|This paper considers iterative learning control (ILC) for formation tracking problem of discrete-time multi-agent system with unknown system dynamics. It is assumed that each agent has its own system dynamics. Thus, the unknown system dynamics and information interaction between multi-agent make formation tracking difficult to achieve. In this paper, we utilize the adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) algorithm to approximate the system parameters only with input and output data. Then a learning control scheme is proposed with estimated system dynamics. Simulations show trajectories of multi-agent are tracked precisely after a certain number of iterations.

The designed intelligent agent system has two layers. The lower layer agent is composed of photovoltaic power agent, wind power agent, energy storage agent and load agent. Those lower agents collect the data from field devices, and each agent analyzes the data, then the information from each agent is uploaded to the upper agent that works as center control agent. The upper agent deals with all information from each lower agent and produce control commands. Then the commands are sent to respective lower agents, and are carried out at field devices that correspond with lower agents respectively. An experiment based on JADE platform is done to verify the possibility of proposed control method. Experimental results show the designed multi-agent can realize the coordination control of the DC micro-grid.

42|5170567|Conference Paper|2009|Ping-Yu Chang|Incorporating DCSP Algorithms into Multi-agent System for Supply Chain Collaboration - A Case Study for Manufacturing Supply Chain|Nowadays, products are expected to have features such as more innovative, multi functional, high quality, and low price because of the changing of consumers'; purchasing behavior. This phenomenon forces manufacturing industries to lower their cost, shorten innovation time, and collaborate with companies in their supply chain. However, it is difficult to collaborate among supply chain companies because of the wide distribution and limitations of companies. Due to the characteristics of agents, such as autonomous ability, social ability (communicative), applying multi-agent system (MAS) to supply chain collaboration has been demonstrated with fascinating results. Furthermore, supply chain collaboration problem can be regarded as a distributed constraints satisfaction problem (DCSP) since constraints are diverted in supply chain echelons. Therefore, incorporating DCSP techniques into MAS will form the basis for achieving better decision among supply chain collaboration. However, related research is lack and to be wanting. Hence, this paper develops a DCSP algorithm that can be appropriately applied for manufacturing (OEM) supply chain collaboration. Our research finds that using a suitable DCSP algorithm, time and cost can be reduced in manufacturing supply chain and better effectiveness can be achieved for future competition.

Agent-based modeling is the latest approach which has virtually replaced the use of traditional techniques of equation based models &amp; micro simulations for social systems analysis. This new paradigm, in addition to being applied to model &amp; analyze various social systems, is also finding widespread application in diverse domains such as economics, business organizations and computational systems. The findings of agent-based models of social systems not only help obtaining a better understanding of the investigated phenomenon but also provide valuable inputs for design of agent-based computational formulations for solving different problems in varied domains. In this paper, we have tried to characterize the use of multi-agent based modeling approach of social contagion and emergent collective behavior along with our experimental work on neighbourhood aggregation model. The paper concludes with a short discussion of the relevant implications for multi-agent systems design.

The latter comprises a team of inferior caribou agents attempting to escape from a single yet superior (in terms of sensory abilities, raw speed, and maximum energy) wolf agent in a simulated two-dimensional infinite toroidal world. We experimentally verified the survival value of empathy in that it improves both the efficiency of evolution of the escaping behavior and the effectiveness of such a behavior. Also, we concluded that swarming facilitates a faster evolution of caribou agents while preserving the effectiveness of their evolved behavior.

42|1043656|Conference Paper|2002|null|A multi-agent approach to power system normal state operations|This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to power system switching operations in normal states. The proposed multi-agent system consists of several facilitator-agents (FAGs), equipment-agents (EAGs) and switch-box-agents (SBAGs). FAG acts as a manager for negotiation process between agents. EAG corresponds to an equipment of the electric power system such as a bus, a transformer and a transmission line, while SBAG is a pseudo-object which consists of neighboring circuit breakers and disconnecting switches. The proposed multi-agent system realizes appropriate switching operations by interacting with neighboring agents. Computer tests on a model system show that the proposed approach is effective and promising.

The individual sensing range is taken as limited and agents are assumed not able to communicate. The concept of extendible periodic formation is established to represent a class of large-scale systems and later used in the proof of stability. In the control strategy, the periodic formation is first partially reached with some misalignments. Then, in order to eliminate the misalignments, a multi-shape matching algorithm is designed to identify them and reach the predefined formation. The concept of group control edge is proposed, whose different types are analyzed. It is shown that under optimal sizes, the convergence rate could be maximized. Moreover, a premature stop strategy is presented that could reduce computation burden. Analysis is made on numerical examples to demonstrate the performance and merits of the proposed method.

First, the hybrid multi-agent system model with disturbances and nonlinear term is proposed, which is composed of continuous-time dynamic agents and discrete-time dynamic agents. Second, the definition of the second-order consensus of hybrid multi-agent system is given. Then, we assume that the interaction among all agents happens in sampling time and each continuous-time dynamic agent can observe its own states in real time. Based on the equivalent approaching law and the states information among agents, the sliding mode control protocols are designed to achieve the second-order consensus of the hybrid multi-agent system. Some sufficient conditions are given for solving the second-order consensus under the sliding mode control protocols. Finally, some simulations are also given to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.
42|796502|Conference Paper|1999|Liu Yufeng|Research on the multi-agent model of autonomous distributed control systems|When designing a large-scale system, it is more effective to consider the system as a set of sub-systems, and to design each sub-system and its relations respectively. Modern manufacturing systems are becoming larger and more complex and demanding more flexibility. To consider the control of such systems, it would be difficult to apply traditional centralized control because of the deficiencies in robustness and flexibility. The concept of decentralized control is being adopted. Many researchers find that the multi-agent model is suitable for such decentralized control. Our research is concerned with applying the theory of multi-agent models to autonomous distributed manufacturing systems.

42|6132446|Journal Article|2012|Fenghui Ren|Conceptual Design of A Multi-Agent System for Interconnected Power Systems Restoration|Outages and faults in interconnected power systems may cause cascading sequences of events, and catastrophic failures of power systems. How to efficiently manage power systems and restore the systems from faults is a challenging research issue in power engineering. Multi-agent systems are employed to address such a challenge in recent years. A centralized coordination strategy was firstly introduced to manage agents in a power system. Such a strategy usually adopts a single central coordinator to control the whole system for system management, maintenance, and restoration purposes. However, disadvantages such as deficiencies in robustness, openness, and flexibility prevent this strategy from extensive online applications. Consequently, a decentralized coordination strategy was proposed to overcome such limitations. But the decentralized coordination strategy cannot efficiently provide a global solution when serious faults spread out in a power system. In this paper, a conceptual multi-agent system design is introduced to express our proposal in power system modeling. A novel dynamic team forming mechanism is proposed to dynamically manage agents in power system with a flexible coordination structure, so as to balance the effectiveness and efficiency of the introduced multi-agent system. The results from simulations of case studies indicate the performance of the proposed multi-agent model.

Within a multi-agent system, a broker Agent can assign project scheduling tasks to different worker Agents using different project scheduling algorithms.
42|5633648|Conference Paper|2010|Abdel Rahman Alkharabsheh|A Multi-Agent Approach for Self-Diagnosis of a Hydrocephalus Shunting System|The human brain is immersed in cerebrospinal fluid, which protects it from mechanical stresses and helps support its weight through buoyancy. A constant overproduction, blockage or reabsorption difficulty can result in a build-up of fluid in the skull (Hydrocephalus), which can lead to brain damage or even death. Existing treatments rely on passive implantable shunts that drain the excess fluid out of the skull cavity, thus keeping intracranial pressure in equilibrium. Shunt malfunction is one of the most common clinical problems in pediatric neurosurgery. Unfortunately, symptoms of various shunt complications can be very similar thus complicating the diagnosing process. It is proposed to complement the existing implanted valve with an intracranial pressure sensor, flowmeter and transceiver to be able to make a self-diagnosis. By using such method, all current shunt malfunctions should be detected early and the types of these malfunctions would be predicted. Currently, a mechatronic valve with control software is under investigation and it will be a future solution for most of current shunt problems. This paper describes the design of a multi-agent system for self-diagnosis of hydrocephalus shunting system. An intelligent concept for intelligent agents is proposed that would deal with any shunt malfunctions in an independent and efficient way, with different agents cooperating and communicating through message exchange, each agent specialised in specific tasks of the diagnosis process. Six types of agents have been proposed to detect any faults in hierarchical way. This paper proposed one of the most promising methods for the self-diagnosis and monitoring of hydrocephalus shunting system based on a novel multi-agent approach.

A novel event-triggered containment control protocol is proposed so as to carry out intermittent examination of the event-triggering condition at sampling instants. One important feature of the designed protocol is that only the sampled position data are used with no utilization of velocity measurements. It is shown that the realization of containment control is guaranteed under a sufficient condition which depends upon the control gains, the sampling period, and the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix among the followers. The effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered containment control protocol is demonstrated by a simulation example.

We show how an event-B model can be structured from AUML protocol diagrams and then used to give a formal semantic to protocol diagrams which supports proofs of their correctness. More precisely, we give rules for the translation of protocol diagrams into event-B language. In particular, we focus on the translation of messages with response delay. The event-B language allows the definition of invariant describing required interaction properties and provides an automatic proof. By an example of multi-agent systems interaction protocol, we illustrate the proposed translation.

The dynamics of each follower agent is described by a linear system subject to both actuator saturation and external disturbances. The dynamics of leader agent is also described by a linear system which generate both the tracking signal and disturbance as the exosystem does in output regulation problem for individual system. Solvability conditions are established based on the agent dynamics and the communication topology. For the follower agents, low-and-high gain based linear state feedback control laws are constructed such that all the outputs of agents achieve output consensus when the communication topology among the follower agents is a connected undirected graph, and the leader is a neighbor of at least one follower. Simulation results are given to illustrate the theoretical results.
43|9354779|Journal Article|2021|Luis Burbano|Dynamic Data Integration for Resilience to Sensor Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems|In recent years the number of security incidents affecting control systems has increased. These incidents have shown the need to develop strategies to improve system resilience to cyber-attacks. This paper presents a practical implementation of a strategy to detect cyber-attacks and mitigate their effects on sensors of a multi-agent system. The proposed approach computes, in real-time, a convex combination of measurements from main and redundant sensors, producing a trust value of the measurement and feeding it to the controller. We implemented this approach on a testbed of ground robots in formation. Experimental results to various kinds of attacks and a key performance index show that the proposed strategy reduces the effects of attacks not only on the affected agent, but also prevents the propagation of the attack over the remaining agents.

An implicit numerical integration method is used in the aim of both obtaining the best results in terms of accuracy and having the possibility to integrate a high detailed model which allows reflecting a more realistic power system behavior. A simple load shedding action is adapted to avoid the power system transient instability based on CCT estimation. The developed architecture was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and JADE framework and the simulation results show that the proposed technique is very efficient and can be used on-line for power system transient instability estimation and control. In this work, for the simulations purpose, we assume that the time delay communications between both agents and IDEs is neglected.
43|7792586|Journal Article|2017|Ala Shariati|A Descriptor Approach to Robust Leader-Following Output Consensus of Uncertain Multi-Agent Systems With Delay|In this technical note, a descriptor approach to leader-following output consensus of multi-agent systems with both stationary and dynamic leaders is given in the presence of transmission delay and model uncertainty. The proposed method can deal with stable and unstable agents described by general linear models. To this end, a new proportional-derivative-integral (PID) consensus protocol for the closed-loop multi-agent system is proposed under a directed graph. Applying this consensus protocol to the multi-agent system leads to a time-delay closed-loop equation of neutral type. To deal with the resulting neutral system, a descriptor model transformation is used to derive delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of the consensus protocol in terms of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The application of the proposed method is illustrated in a teleoperation system. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A new method is used to solve the problem, which is Laplace transform. According to the Laplace transform, the accurate solution of the system can be solved, and the state of the consensus center can be found. It is proved that the agents of the system will aggregate and form a cohesive cluster around the consensus center in a finite time under certain conditions. Moreover, a new system about the non-autonomous agents is discussed. Finally, some simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results.
43|6721993|Conference Paper|2013|Andranik S. Akopov|A Multi-agent Genetic Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization|In this paper a new multi-agent genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization (MAGAMO) is presented. The algorithm based on the dynamical interaction of synchronized agents which are interdepended genetic algorithms (GAs) having own separate evolutions of their populations. This approach has some similarities with well known &#034;island model&#034; of GA. In both methods is used a migration of individuals from agents (&#034;islands&#034;) to the main process (&#034;continent&#034;). In contrast, the intelligent agents in MAGAMO are able to decompose the dimensions space to form evolutions of subpopulations (instead of distribution of initial population as in the standard &#034;island model&#034;). In the same time, the main (central) process is responsible for the coordination of agents only and their selection according Pareto rules (without evolution). Intelligent agents seek local sub optimal solutions for a global optimization, which will be completed in the result of the interaction of all agents. In the result of this, the amount of needed recalculating the fitness-functions can be significantly reduced. It is especially important for the multi-objective optimization related to a large-scale problem. Besides, the proposed approximating approach allows solving complex optimization problems for real big systems (like an oil company, plants, corporations, etc.).

Filippou|On the detailed design issues of a multi-agent architecture based on CUDA threads towards efficiently Simulating WSN Systems|Emulators used in sensor network simulation are bounded to specific hardware. Adding different modules of hardware (RF';s, MCU';s, FPGA';s) to these simulators-emulators is a hard and time consuming task. In this paper we extend an integrated generic emulator, module of a recently proposed, by the authors [3], WSN simulator architecture, capable of emulating any MCU/FPGA/DSP chip functionality completely described in XML file format with integrating CUDA emulated capabilities. The suggested architecture is based on novel Multi-agent and Multi-Threading technology concepts and is designed for the CUDA ready implementation. The basic modules and the pseudocode of this implementation is herein presented along with the essential setup. In [3] we proposed the agent mechanism (token interpreter) as the backbone of a WSN simulator. In this paper we extend in detail the design for the use of this interpreter as a CUDA thread, dealing with problems such as communication cost, thread conflict and kernel concurrent execution. We analyze the implementation of data structures, we introduce the necessary transformations to improve performance as well as we present initial validation of its performance regarding multithreading overheads for the CPU and GPU implementations.

Therefore, the load demand and power generation of the system should be matched in real-time. In this paper, a novel multi-agent system-based real-time load management technique is proposed to optimally determine the switch status of loads in DC zones while satisfying the operating constraints of the system in real-time. The multi-agent system cooperative control protocol is developed based on a proposed reduced-order agent model and artificial potential function of the multi-agent system, which aims to maximize the energized loads in the all-electric ship power system. The cooperative controller aims to cooperatively achieve the group objectives that are difficult to reach by centralized controller. Further, simulation results verify the viability and performance of the proposed technique in PSCAD/EMTDC software.

The formation in this paper can be specified by time-varying continuously differentiable vectors and the dynamics of each agent has nonlinearity. Firstly, a nonlinear time-varying formation control protocol is proposed based on the distributed observer. Then a nonsingular transformation matrix is constructed using the property of the Laplacian matrix. Sufficient conditions for the second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems to achieve time-varying formations are presented using only position feedback, where a description of the feasible time-varying formation set is given. Thirdly, an algorithm with three steps is proposed to design the distributed observer-based formation control protocol. By using the Lyapunov theory, the stability of the proposed algorithm is proven. Finally, a numerical example with five nonlinear agents is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

The objective of this paper is to design controllers such that each agent can accurately track the reference signal and reject the disturbance. The disturbance and reference signal are generated by an exosystem. It is assumed that only a part of agents can obtain the state and system matrix of the exosystem. Then, distributed fixed-time observers are firstly proposed to estimate them, which can ensure the fixed-time convergence of the estimation errors. Next, we design both state feedback controller and output feedback controller to solve the FTOR problem using feedforward method. By virtue of Lyapunov theory and output regulation technique, it is shown that the proposed control strategy can solve the FTOR problem. Finally, a numerical example is included for illustration.

A fully distributed event-triggered output feedback formation tracking (FDETOFFT) control scheme is constructed to address this problem. It is noteworthy that the control scheme does not involve any global information, which enables it to be implemented in a fully distributed fashion. The biggest contribution of this study is to extend event-triggered techniques to the formation tracking control scheme. Compared with previous related works, continuous communication between neighboring agents is avoided. Moreover, it is further proved that no agents exhibit the Zeno behavior.

By integrating data from multiple sensor nodes, WSN is able to complete the task which a single sensor node can not complete. In order to give full play to WSN functions, the sensor nodes need collaboration. Agent and MAS can be regarded as the further development of a distributed problem-solving. The collaboration among agents can improve individual agent and MAS performance, enhance the agent and MAS'; ability to solve problems. Collaboration is the core issue in the MAS.In consideration of the similarity of WSN to MAS, agent can be arranged in sensor nodes to solve problems of sensor nodes collaboration. This paper describes in detail the deployment of agents in WSN system, using agent collaboration to coordinate multiple sensor nodes to complete data collection and analysis, and the distributed fault diagnosis. And simulation is carried out in OMNET++ platform with good effect. This paper describes the structure of agent used in this WSN, and introduces the functionality of agents of each node in this system, and overall structure of the system.

Motivated by vertex coloring from graph theory, we explore an approach based on tentative overlay as a condition mapping from interrelation and interaction between each agent, which equipped with local sensing and wireless communication capabilities. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to achieve synchronization, that is, making the most of cooperation of the agents in the multi-agent systems with network';s connectivity, while other than nearest neighbor information, our approach assumes no knowledge of global network topology. We provide analysis and design results for multi-agent networks in arbitrary dimensions topology. The novel correctness poof relies on proximity graphs and their properties. In addition, simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, for which we show a distributed dynamic programming of multi-agent system.
43|8287543|Conference Paper|2017|Weimin Shi|Adaptive fault-tolerant tracking control for singular multi-agent systems|In this paper, the consensus tracking problem of singular multi-agent systems with actuator faults is considered. The interaction topology among following agents is assumed to be undirected and connected. An adaptive law is adopted in the proposed protocol to adjust the coupling weight, which implements the protocol in a fully distributed fashion. To compensate the poor effects caused by actuator faults, the gain matrices involved in the protocol are constructed by the positive definite solution of the generalized Riccati equation. Based on the Lyapunov method, the singular multi-agent systems can achieve consensus via the proposed protocol. As a special case, the proposed approach can be used to solve the consensus tracking problem of linear multi-agent systems with actuator faults directly. Finally, a simulation result is included to testify our established result.
44|4076001|Conference Paper|2006|Jignesh M. Solanki|Multi-Agent System for Islanded Operation of Distribution Systems|The increasing penetration of local generators called distributed generators (DGs) has created a need for changing restoration schemes. Under islanded scenarios, a DG or a group of DGs can continue to supply a portion of the system that has been separated from the main utility system. However, the island may have a power imbalance and need load shedding in order to maintain it. This paper presents a decentralized restoration solution under such an islanded condition. This decentralized solution is a multi-agent system (MAS) with four types of agents. This MAS in development is responsible for load shedding after occurrence of an island and thereafter restoration of the shed loads if possible. The system is implemented in virtual test bed (VTB) and Java agent development framework (JADE) is used as an agent development toolkit

Pouyan Ali|An agent based multilayered architecture for E-learning system|E-learning refers to the way by which the learning content is provided by means of electronic technology. In a traditional E-learning system, there is only one layer and all agents and services are connected together. The architecture of the proposed E-learning system, in this paper, contains four tier layers. It is based on multi agent systems'; paradigm.

These features include intelligence, distributed nature, adaptive attitude, interaction, accessibility and security. We have used multilayer modeling approach to provide flexible and light weight systems for E-learning environments.

However, there is still a lack of work on distributed approach to diffusion computing. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent diffusion approach where a massive data set is split into several subsets and each diffusion agent only needs to work with one subset in diffusion computation. We apply it to a large set of human decision-making experiences. The result indicates that the multi-agent diffusion approach is beneficial, and the system performance could be affected significantly by the splitting granularity (size of each splitting unit). This study encourages further theoretical investigations on the potential impacts of splitting granularity on the recoverability of the global diffusion map.

In existing applications usually a communication protocol defined between agents. But defining a protocol between agents cause some problems; for example it is possible that agents recognize a subject, but because it is not defined in their protocol, they can';t express any thing about that. In this paper we propose a new method for evolution of a communication protocol between intelligent agents, after that the experimental results will be discussed and at the end of the paper future works and conclusion.

We consider interactions or co-ordination among agents such that an agent can not move to a destination cell occupied by agents more than the agents of a current cell. This paper shows that a moving multiagent with an appropriate average moving speed is more stable than a moving multi-agent without average moving speed from both theory and experiments.
44|9590850|Conference Paper|2021|Zi-Yang Cheng|Research on Self-Triggered Controller for Finite-Time Consensus of Multi-Agent System|This paper is concerned with a multi-agent system to achieve finite-time consensus utilizing self-triggered control. In previous research, event-driven control for finite-time consensus of multi-agent system still needs continuous communication to update the trigger function. Therefore, we introduce a trigger function based on broadcast state which only updates at each event along with the controller. It is proved that such self-triggered controller satisfies the requirements of finite-time consensus. And the system does not exhibit Zeno behavior if and only if the precision of state error is lower bounded. Simulation results show that although self-triggered control has greater estimation error in consensus time, it saves more computation and communication resource compared with event-driven control.

The conventional double power-rate attracting law is modified for forming GAL, by adding a proportional term, and the convergence rate of the system can be dramatically improved. Through the two-phase analysis, an estimate for the upper bound of the settling time function is given, by which the obtained upper bound depends upon the initial state, and is finite without regard to the value of the initial state. The GAL is adopted for the purpose of consensus of multi-agent systems. A nonlinear protocol is designed to make the system undertaken achieve finite-duration consensus, and numerical results are presented to validate its effectiveness.

44|4593811|Conference Paper|2008|Jun Peng|Multi-agent coordination method based on fuzzy Q-learning|Traditional reinforcement learning algorithm can only solve the learning problem of the intelligent agent with discrete state space and discrete action space. This paper studies the coordination of multiple intelligent agents in a complicated dynamic environment with uncertainty. A coordination model based on the fuzzy Q-learning technique is suggested. This model uses fuzzy logic to generalize the agentpsilas continuous state space. Every agent, when making decisions on its actions, needs to consider the influences of other agents to the environment. The agent first evaluates the actions they select, then, uses the fuzzy Q-learning to learn their action strategy. In the process, the action keeps improving and the conflicts among agents can be resolved. This model was used in the RoboCup soccer simulation game and the simulation results showed that the performance of attacking is obviously improved.

An examination of current software-engineering approaches to self-organizing MAS identified a lack of requirement engineering approaches, established in general- purpose engineering methodologies. As self-organizing dynamics are typically utilized to enforce continuous MAS adjustment we discuss how expectations on MAS adaptivity can be expressed and validated, considering both the intended system configurations as well as the system dynamics that steer system (re-)configuration. We argue that self-organizing MAS development typically intends recurring pattern of system dynamics and exemplify their specification and validation, transferring requirements engineering practices to self-organizing MAS development.

Multi-agent System (MAS) is an effective method of solving distributed problems logically and physically, which has such merits as high adaptability, high reliability and easy to expand and maintain. The control model of GTPST is established based on MAS in this paper. Due to the limitation of the available network bandwidth and the large time delay of satellite-ground links, we develop some applications based on mobile agent which can perform its execution locally on remote site, only return the final result or desired data back to local site. As no operation and communication between remote and local sites are needed during the execution of the mobile agent, valuable bandwidth can be reserved and saved. Meanwhile, communication protocols of MAS are improved and designed to increase the communication efficiency of the system. The availability of the system is verified by the test the simulated service satellite (SSS) replaces cell unit for the simulated client satellite (SCS) finally.

44|8241821|Journal Article|2018|Xiaozheng Jin|Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Consensus for a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems With Circuit Implementation|In this paper, a robust fault-tolerant consensus control strategy and its circuit implementation method are proposed for a class of nonlinear second-order leader-following multi-agent systems against multiple actuator faults and time-varying state/input-dependent system uncertainties. The faults of partial loss of actuator effectiveness and bias-actuators are considered without knowing eventual faulty information. The uncertainties are supposed to be structured and to satisfy integral quadratic constraints. The nonlinear dynamics of underlying systems are described by linear state-dependent functions based on the differential mean value theorem. By designing adaptive schemes and state-feedback control gains, a novel distributed control strategy is constructed to ensure the asymptotic consensus of agents in the presence of actuator faults, uncertainties, and nonlinear dynamics. The control strategy is further physically implemented based on the circuit theory. The efficiency of the developed control circuits is verified by a multiple coupled nonlinear forced pendulum system based on a circuit simulation software.
44|4054855|Conference Paper|2006|Qusay H. Mahmoud|Applying the MVC Design Pattern to Multi-Agent Systems|As agent technology becomes more wide-spread, the need for agent-based analysis and design methods and tools will keep growing. An agent, which is an autonomous entity that acts on behalf of the user, has different properties than objects. For example, objects are passive entities that react to external stimuli, but do not exhibit goal directed behavior. On the other hand, agents are active entities that may learn about their environment and react to changes. Because of such crucial differences between objects and agents, object-oriented analysis and design methods cannot accommodate the requirements of engineering agent-based systems. Agents, however, can learn a few things from object-oriented analysis and design. In this paper, we present the AgentViews approach for applying the model view controller (MVC) design pattern in designing agent-based systems. This approach will help software developers use a familiar design pattern to determine the types of agents needed to build successful agent-based systems

The different kind of data (both useful and useless information) is available close to us. We don';t need to know where it is physically located to use existing services. The only we need is to have the access to the global network. In this way we often can decrease the time we need to do following things such as doing shopping, checking news, exchanging our opinions, etc. Some years ago it took much more time... But making our life easier by increasing our time needed to arrange our life is not the most important thing, in my opinion. The really most important is to allow people who live in different countries to exchange the knowledge and offer distance learning. This kind of the use of the global network guarantees that people can be better educated and the development of science will accelerate.

Hussain|Agent-based system architecture for wireless sensor networks|This paper presents an ongoing research on developing an agent based system architecture for wireless sensor networks. The main objective of this system is to facilitate the design, implementation, and maintenance of applications for sensor networks that consist of wireless sensor nodes. The proposed system architecture contains four types of agents: interface, regional, cluster, and query agents. The interface agents receive queries from the users and return the results back to them. The regional agent is responsible for sending query packets to the cluster agents. The cluster agents disseminate query into the network and provide efficient in-network processing. Finally, the query agents process the query in the sensor node. The delegation of specific tasks to different software agents facilitates the development and maintenance of sensor network applications.

The communication topology is the undirected subgraph with directed connections between the leader and the followers. Based on the relative states of neighbors and a general actuator fault model, an adaptive fault-tolerant control protocol is proposed to compensate for the failure effects on consensus tracking where the feedback matrices update the parameters by the online estimation of actuator faults. The criteria of reaching consensus tracking despite the actuator faults for both linear and Lipschitz nonlinear agents are derived, respectively. Finally, two examples are included to illustrate the theoretical results.

Razibul Islam|A Distributed Multi-Agent Based Emergency Control Approach Following Catastrophic Disturbances in Interconnected Power Systems|This paper presents a decentralized emergency control approach for preventing voltage instability by controlling the reactive power and voltage of the system. The proposed control algorithm is based on a distributed architecture of intelligent agents to identify the affected region and to activate timely countermeasures to achieve a fast and accurate response. By dividing the network into several areas, the voltage instability problem can be localized and countermeasures can be directed to the most affected area by the authorized local agent. This facilitates quick decision making within the system. To achieve effective voltage and reactive power support, a sensitivity based zone formation is proposed. The Nordic32 74-bus test system has been used for testing the proposed multi-agent emergency control (MAEC). The results from the case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MAEC approach.

Experimental results show that this algorithm achieves good performance when the size of problem increases, and almost has a linear time complexity.
45|5360554|Conference Paper|2009|Xiangjun Cheng|Distributed Traffic Signal Control Approach Based on Multi-agent|This paper establishes a distributed and coordinated traffic signal control system based on multi-agent (DTCMAS), in which there is no control center. Each intersection is controlled by a local agent independently. In the meantime, the signal control agents improves the control effect of global network by communication and coordination among agents in adjacent intersections. Because every agent comprises knowledge-database and reasoning mechanism, the DTCMAS not only fully considers the information of fleets of cars and traffic conditions in around intersections, but also takes the realization of global optimizing for traffic control of road network into account and reduces the complexity of control algorithm greatly. The result of simulation shows that the DTCMAS signal control approach reduces 37.8% total stop delay of cars averagely than the fixed-time method and reduces 17.8% total stop delay of cars averagely than the actuated method under the same condition.

45|9610123|Early Access Article|2021|Wei Wang|Distributed Cooperative Output Regulation of Linear Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems|In this paper, the output regulation problem of fully distributed linear heterogeneous multi-agent systems via event-triggered communication is investigated. A novel information acquisition scheme is proposed, which can effectively save the computing resources of the controller. The time-invariant matrix S is obtained directly through completely distributed communication. Therefore, the computational burden caused by the introduction of matrix observer is reduced. At the same time, to save communication resources, this paper adopts a communication scheme and designs a Zeno-free event-triggered mechanism for each agent. The trigger mechanism in this paper can avoid the continuous monitoring of the system state, and does not need to supplement the self-triggering algorithm. In addition, the control strategy designed in this paper is fully distributed with fixed parameters, and the use of global information can be avoided without using dynamic parameters in the controller. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In comparison with existing MAS-based service restoration approaches in a two-layer cyber-physical architecture, excluding the dispatch of MESSs, we propose a three-layer framework that consists of cyber, physical, and transportation layers corresponding to the communication scheme for the MAS, electric distribution system, and transportation network for MESSs, respectively. In the proposed MAS framework, agents communicate and cooperate with each other for service restoration without violating system operation constraints by conducting the following actions: i) Kruskal-algorithm-based island reconfiguration (switch agent), ii) generation of switching sequence and dispatches of DGs and SESSs (DG and static battery agents) under monitored loading condition (load agent), and iii) dispatch of MESSs based on optimal road routing using the Dijkstra algorithm (mobile battery agent). Case studies were carried out in an IEEE 33-bus distribution system, and the results validated the performance of the proposed approach in terms of number of restored loads and restoration time steps, voltage level, and state of charge of the SESSs and MESSs with different numbers of fault lines and SESSs/MESS, and different extents of damaged roads.

To solve such a problem, by combining the non-singular terminal sliding-mode control (NTSMC) and disturbance observer based control (DOBC) methods together, a distributed active anti-disturbance cooperative control scheme is proposed. Firstly, to estimate the matched/mismatched disturbances of each follower, a finite-time disturbance observer is constructed. Secondly, by distributedly employing the mismatched disturbances estimates, integral-type non-singular terminal sliding-mode surfaces are designed for followers. Thirdly, distributed protocols are proposed based on the surfaces. In the presence of mismatched disturbances, these protocols achieve finite-time output consensus for the agents. Simulations validate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulations.

46|9232656|Conference Paper|2020|Yuan Yu|Research on coordinating optimization strategy of integrated energy system based on multi-agent consistency theory|With the development of communication technology, the level of informatization and intelligence of energy systems continues to increase. The integrated energy system (IES) considering the mixed energy supply of electric, heat, gas and information is an effective approach to improve the rational allocation of energy. The optimized configuration of network power flow can not only improve the efficiency of energy utilization, but also reduce the network redundancy as much as possible through a high level of coupling. In this paper, based on improved discrete consistency algorithm, a coordinating optimization method is proposed that aims to optimize the multi-area interconnected IES. First, an IES model considering the mixed energy supply of electric, heat and gas is constructed in a single region. Based on the model, an objective function with the maximum return is established on the premise of assuming that the prices of electric, heat and gas can be used as an economic means to adjust the energy utilization. Then, the consistency theory is applied to the IES, and the improved discrete consistency algorithm is used to optimize the objective function. Finally, a certain region IES is taken as an example in Northeast China. The case study demonstrates that the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.
46|9238417|Early Access Article|2020|Yang Liu|Adaptive Fuzzy Containment Control for Multi-Agent Systems with State Constraints Using Unified Transformation Functions|In this paper, the finite-time containment control problem of the nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) is investigated, in which the follower agents are subjected to full state constraints. The fuzzy logic system is employed to approximate the uncertain dynamic of the nonlinear MAS. A new nonlinear transformation function (NTF) is proposed, which serves as a unified tool for coping with the systems subjected to state constraints and no constraint. By combing the variable transformation with the proposed NTF, the original systems with state constraints are converted into the equivalent free-constrained systems. Moreover, as long as the boundedness of the states in transformed systems is guaranteed, the states of the original MAS don';t transgress the preassigned boundaries. Based on the finite-time stability theory, the adaptive fuzzy control scheme is constructed for the transformed systems. It is proved that the outputs of all the followers are driven to converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders in finite time, and all the signals in the closedloop systems are bounded in sense of mean square. The full state constraints for the followers are not violated all the time. Specially, the control structure does not need to change even there is no constraint imposes on the state. Finally, simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed finite-time control scheme.

To test the efficiency of this model and the effectiveness of different reactive behaviors, the performance of this model was investigated under different selection probabilities.
46|7250293|Conference Paper|2015|Yong Ou Yang|Argumentative dialogue revision in multi-agent system|Most of the traditional belief revisions were built on a completely reliable set of static beliefs between the believable intelligent agents, which are unrealistic due to their inability to identify the credibility of faith. Argumentative dialogue is a basic method for intelligent agents in multi-agent system to eliminate differences between them and reach a consensus. In this paper we will establish an argumentative dialogue framework for intelligent agents'; dialogue process by using the argumentative theory and transforming dialogue beliefs of agents into arguments, and building an original argumentative dialogue tree based on the relationship of arguments. Then we calculate the credible belief set of each agent after turning the original argumentative dialogue tree into standard argumentative dialogue tree. At last we calculate the acceptable belief set to make each agent';s mind reach an agreement. This method is characterized by high efficiency, good adaptability, easy realization, and removing forged or incredible beliefs to a certain extent.
46|7895192|Journal Article|2018|Muhammad Saim|Distributed Average Tracking in Multi-Agent Coordination: Extensions and Experiments|This paper addresses the distributed average tracking (DAT) problem for a group of agents to track the average of multiple time-varying reference signals, each of which is available to only one agent, under local interaction with neighbors and an undirected graph. We consider three cases: 1) DAT for single-integrator dynamics with a chain of integrators in algorithm design; 2) DAT with swarm behavior for single-integrator dynamics; and 3) DAT with swarm behavior for double-integrator dynamics. First, a continuous distributed algorithm with a chain of two integrators is proposed for single-integrator dynamics, where each agent needs its own and its neighbors'; filter outputs obtained through communication besides its absolute position, local relative positions, reference signal, and reference velocity. The introduced algorithm can deal with a wide class of reference signals with steady deviations among reference velocities. Then, two swarm-based DAT algorithms for, respectively, single- and double-integrator dynamics are presented. In the first swarm-based algorithm for single-integrator dynamics, each agent needs to measure the relative positions between itself and its neighbors, while in the second swarm-based algorithm for double-integrator dynamics, relative velocity information is required too. In both cases, the information can be obtained through local sensing. If correct initialization constraints can be achieved, the center of the agents will track the average of the reference signals and the agents will maintain connectivity and avoid interagent collision. Numerical simulations are also presented to illustrate the theoretical results. Finally, the algorithms presented in this paper are experimentally implemented and validated on a multirobot platform.

In this paper, Multi Agent Controller (MAC) has been proposed to maintain the system operational criterions such as the maintenance of voltage and other parameters. This has been implemented in two area network to demonstrate the application of MAC where it maintains the continuity of power in the area subjected to fault. MAC is implemented by using an open source agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Simulation is carried out in Mat lab environment. Macsimjx has been used to interface the simulink model with Multi Agent System (MAS). Detailed simulation has been carried out during various fault conditions. The results demonstrate the continuity of power supply to the critical loads through Distributed Energy Resource (DER) even in absence of Grid power.
46|8560463|Conference Paper|2018|Jacek Zawisza|Application of design pattern within the engineering of agent-based control systems|Within production systems. various control decisions have to be taken to ensure a proper system behavior in a distributed but consistent way. To take these control decisions and to ensure the necessary information exchange between them multi-agent systems can be considered for implementation. However. an agent-based control system for a complex production system cannot be implemented in one shot. To overcome this problem two approaches can be successfully applied. On the one hand. a stepwise engineering approach for multi-agent-based control systems solving special control problems and combining them in an appropriate way to a larger agent-based control system can be considered. On the other hand. existing design pattern can be applied to improve the development of the individual multi-agent systems. Within this paper. such a combination will be described.
46|8591336|Conference Paper|2018|Arndt L√ºder|Identifying Design Pattern for Agent Based Production System Control|Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are an implementation paradigm frequently discussed to be used within control system design for flexible production systems. Over the years, on the one hand different kind of MAS-based control architectures, and on the other hand, different agent system design methodologies have been developed with different intentions and focus e.g. Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). Nevertheless, only a few practical applications of MAS in control can be observed. In fact, a MAS developers'; problem is the missed availability of design support for agent-based engineering, to control complex production systems. Therefore, this paper intends to highlight a path towards such a MAS development support exploiting design patterns.

This technical note is aimed at studying the joint impact of the agent dynamic structure and the communication topology on consensusability. For the MASs with fixed topology and agents described by linear time-invariant systems, a necessary condition of consensusability with respect to a set of admissible consensus protocols is given, which is shown, under some mild conditions, to be necessary and sufficient.

These show great promise to help solve many of the difficult challenges of rapidly growing domains such as smart manufacturing. In this position paper we describe our early-stage work on the use of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to optimise coordination in a multi-robot pick and place system. Our goal is to evaluate the feasibility of this new approach in a manufacturing environment. We propose to adopt a decentralised partially observable Markov Decision Process approach and to extend an existing cooperative game work to suitably formulate the problem as a multiagent system. We describe the centralised training/decentralised execution multi-agent learning approach which allows a group of agents to be trained simultaneously but to exercise decentralised control based on their local observations. We identify potential learning algorithms and architectures that we will investigate as a base for our implementation and we outline our open research questions. Finally we identify next steps in our research program.

Focus is now shifted to performance evaluation of real-world applications, in order to quantify the practical benefits and drawbacks of agent systems. Our approach extends current work on generic evaluation methodologies for agents by employing fuzzy weighted trees for organizing evaluation-specific concepts/metrics and linguistic terms to intuitively represent and aggregate measurement information.Furthermore, we introduce meta-metrics that measure the validity and complexity of the contribution of each metric in the overall performance evaluation. These are all incorporated for selecting optimal subsets of metrics and designing the evaluation process incompliance with the demands/restrictions of various evaluation setups, thus minimizing intervention by domain experts. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through the evaluation of a real-world test case.
47|8243790|Conference Paper|2017|Xiaoqian Li|The research of distributed suboptimal controller for continuous-time multi-agent systems|This paper revisits the distributed suboptimal LQR control problem for continuous-time multi-agent systems. Based on the system';s topological structure, we design the distributed controllers in which each subsystem can use the information of its state and its neighbors';. The multi-agent system are described by an identical decoupled dynamical equation and a coupled performance index. Associating with the given matrix G and the designed suboptimal feedback gain matrices, the general distributed suboptimal controllers are obtained. By using the stable eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix, the asymptotical convergence of the modified ARE is proved for infinite-horizon systems under mild conditions. To make this result more persuasively, the consideration for infinite-time distributed systems is presented and the suboptimal controllers are obtained.

Therefore, the Multi-Agent System is used to substitute for the artificial diagnosis in order to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This paper introduces the construction process of the enterprise management diagnosis ontologies and puts forward the Jadex transformation model and the specific transformation method which enables the extended Jadex to support the use of ontology to describe the beliefs. Thus the ontology in Multi-Agent System can be used to describe objects and the common understandings of the relationships. It can promote communication and collaboration efficiency between multi-agents. Meanwhile, it can also improve understanding of domain knowledge. At last, through the ontology-based enterprise diagnostic concept, we establish the multi-agent diagnosis system of enterprise management, and the experiments demonstrate that the ontology-based multi-agent diagnostic system is feasible and efficient for the enterprise management diagnosis.

The multi-agent systems considered in this paper, moreover, the nonaffine functions and uncertain nonlinearities are completely unknown, and the input of each follower agent is quantized through a hysteresis quantizer. Based on the help of the fuzzy logic systems approximator, an adaptive fuzzy finite-time tracking control protocol with adaptive update laws is presented by the backstepping technique. On the basis of the finite-time stability strategy and Bhat and Bernstein theorem, the finite-time stability of designed control protocol is fully analyzed. Under the proposed control protocol, it is indicated that the tracking error of each follower agent can press on a small neighborhood in a finite time. Finally, the effectiveness of designed control protocol in this paper is analyzed by numerical examples.
47|8027548|Conference Paper|2017|Shasha Feng|Effect of network structure to the convergence rate of agents in multi-agent systems|In this paper, we probe into the influence of network structure on the convergence rate of agents in multi-agent systems, especially for the position and number of nodes of network on it. We discover some results of which kinds of networks are conductive to the faster convergence rate of agents in multi-agent systems. Firstly, if there is no ring in different networks where the number of nodes are same, then the network with fork nodes which are connected to the central position node is in favor of the faster convergence of agents; otherwise, the convergence rate of agents is quicker in the network without fork nodes. Secondly, it is inevitable for agents to converge more ane more slowly with the increasing of node number. One way to improve the convergence rate of agents is to enable the increased nodes to connect to the central position node. Finally, when both the position and the number of nodes of different networks are same, it can save communication cost to remove some edges in network under the condition that the convergence rate of agents is affected little. Therefore, we reveal that if the edges which do not connect to the central position directly are removed, then their impact on the convergence rate is little.

The proposed control framework which is independent on the global information about the communication topology consists of two layers. Different from most existing distributed fault-tolerant control (FTC) protocols where the fault in one agent may propagate over network, the developed control method can eliminate the phenomenon of fault propagation. Based on the hierarchical control strategy, the FTCC problem with a directed graph can be simplified to the distributed containment control of the upper layer and the fault-tolerant tracking control of the lower layer. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.
47|4545618|Conference Paper|2008|Yusuke Hamada|NAT Traversal Method for Multi-Agent-Based Meeting Scheduling System|We previously proposed a meeting scheduling system based on mobile agent technology. The users of our system do not need to input all of their schedules unlike the existing groupwares. When a user intends to call a meeting, he only inputs information about the meeting. On behalf of the inviter, mobile agents move around each invited user';s computer to ask whether he can join the meeting and negotiate with him if necessary. In this paper, we propose a NAT traversal method for a meeting scheduling system based on mobile agent technology. In our former system, the users inside a NAT network cannot use the system because mobile agent cannot migrate from outside the NAT network to inside NAT network. For this reason, our proposed system does not work with some network including a NAT router, such as a home network and an office network. To solve this problem, we implemented a new migration method for mobile agents.

Social intelligence can improve agents'; interaction in a multi-agent system. Negotiation is a multi-agent system in which agents are cooperating to reach a joint agreement as well as gain more individual utility. This situation has great potential for conflict between social and individual goals. In this paper, in order to compromise to reach both social and individual goals, emotional-social agents are proposed to manage negotiation interactions. Experimental results show that emotional-social negotiator agents reach fair agreement, and also achieve more individual gain.

According to the continuous homogeneous consensus control technique in finite time for the nominal nonlinear MAS, integral sliding mode (ISM) control with discontinuous feature in company with fuzzy approach is presented to obtain precise free chattering consensus in finite time regard to the external disturbances. Despite most of the similar works, nonlinear dynamics for agents is considered in this paper. In addition, because of control input structure in discontinuous ISM protocol, there is inevitable chattering in control input which is eliminated by fuzzy controller. Finally, numerical simulations has been illustrated to verify efficiency of the suggested strategy.

This thesis proposed a method that all agents just connect with a server to alleviate the complexity of the experiences exchange activities. The server collects learning knowledge loaded from all the agents, merges the knowledge, and shares the knowledge to all agents which lack akin experiences. The agents utilized the proposed Pheromone Mechanism in Ant Colony Algorithm to evaluate whether an experience is worthy to upload to the server. Meanwhile, to deal with the problem of massive data processing, this thesis used the open source software, Apache Hadoop, along with the MapReduce programming model. The agents can take shared experiences integrated with their own knowledge to achieve knowledge sharing and increase the efficiency significantly. The proposed approach in this thesis was implemented by a homemade server and personal computers.

An effective distributed adaptive control strategy was proposed only based on the local state information of the network neighbor agents. The main contribution was a novel dynamics transformation that converted the nonaffine system into an affine system through the mean value theorem.

48|7260789|Conference Paper|2015|Chen Wenhai|Distributed observer-based adaptive consensus protocols for leader-following multi-agent systems|This paper considers the consensus problem of leader-following multi-agent systems under the undirected and connected interaction topology. The dynamics of agents is modeled by the general form of linear system. It is assumed that only a subset of the following agents can access to the state information of the leader, all following agents can not access to the bounded reference input of the leader, and the states of all following agents can not be available directly. To achieve control goal, local state observers are adopted by the agents to estimate its states, by which the distributed observer-based protocols are constructed to solve the leader-following consensus problems. To implement the protocol in fully distributed fashion, the parameters involved in the protocols are governed by the adaptive laws. The full-order and reduce-order observer-based adaptive consensus protocols can be unified in our proposed framework. To track the active leader, a discontinuous control protocol based on the state observers is proposed for each following agent. It is shown that under suitable conditions, all the following agents can track the leader under the provided protocols. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate our obtained result.

The functions of a KMS can be best performed by a network of agents, coordinating, collaborating and cooperating with each other so as to manage the knowledge in such a way that right information is available to the right user at the right time and in the right format. It';s necessary to use intelligent software agents in knowledge based systems so that the difficult tasks are decomposed into smaller sub-tasks and that each sub-task is solved with the most appropriate reasoning technique without increasing the execution time. The same has been achieved by combining the concepts of Multi Agent Systems and Knowledge Management Systems and formulating a Multi Agent Enterprise Knowledge Management System (MAEKMS). Such a MAEMS is used in the field of e-health. This paper uses extended Gaia to design the system and its functional components. A part of the system is implemented using Java and MySql. The multiple agents are developed using JADE (Java Agent Development Environment).

We prove that, when the nonlinear protocol is strictly increasing, consensus can be achieved if and only if the underlying directed interaction graph has a spanning tree. Numerical examples are taken to show the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Since only part of agents can access the reference signal, a distributed observer is designed first. To ensure that each agent';s controlled output almost perfectly tracks a given reference signal with an arbitrarily fast setting time under external disturbance, the distributed observer is designed to be parameterized. Then, both full state protocol and dynamic output protocol are constructed in a distributed sense. On the condition that the undirected communication graph is connected and at least one follower agent connects to the leader agent, our protocols solve the cooperative robust and perfect tracking problem.

However, most of the available solutions are fragile in incomplete, uncertain, and dynamic situations. This paper proposes a novel economically inspired self-healing model for fault tolerant Multi-Agent Systems where the agents are self-interested autonomic elements collaborate to achieve fault tolerance as a given high-level objective of the system. It is an effective solution for dynamic situations with a high possibility of uncertainty. The proposed model is in fact toward responding the challenge of negotiation theory for autonomic systems introduced by IBM. In particular, it is an inspiration of general explanation of Communism, Socialism, and Capitalism. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed social approach in comparison to the cases of no help situation, using purely redundant components, and helping without using a social value.

The proposed optimized tracking cooperative control strategy relaxes the assumptions in existing works that the control gain and the local input must be continuous and the states information exchange has no recourse constraints. With the conditions of the optimized consensus and the communication cost being satisfied, the tracking cooperative control law with bounded parameters is developed based on the periodic samples. It shows that if the sampling condition is satisfied, the multi-agent systems will reach the optimized consensus. Simulation results are provided to verify the proposed approach.

48|9594092|Early Access Article|2021|Ramasamy Saravanakumar|Reliable Memory Sampled-Data Consensus of Multi-agent Systems with Nonlinear Actuator Faults|This article proposes a memory-based sampled-data consensus framework for general linear multi-agent systems (MAS) in the presence of a class of nonlinear actuator faults (NAF). To reduce state exchanges and preserve energy resources, communication between the neighbouring agents are based on only samples of the states with variable sampling intervals. As two common constraints in the actuators, the bounded nonlinear partial loss of effectiveness and bias faults are both taken into account in the problem formulation. Sufficient conditions to guarantee consensus under the given circumstances are derived as linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions. Different from existing Lyapunov-Krasovskii-based methods, the proposed design framework in this article is based on a looped functional approach which reduces the conservation in designing the required consensus control gains. This less conservative approach allows a larger sampling interval as well as more severe actuator faults which together enhance the practicability of the proposed approach. Simulation results based on a tunnel diode circuit and a nonholonomic mobile robot MASs quantify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the improved sampling intervals.

A novel hybrid eventtriggering mechanism is proposed to reduce the burden of network transmission, and it is ensured that Zeno behavior does not occur. Besides, it is required that the control protocol is only updated at agent‚Äôs own triggering instant.

An example is given to verify the correctness of the proposed hybrid event-triggered control strategy.

The objective system includes actuator faults, mismatched parameter uncertainties, nonlinear functions, and exogenous disturbances under switching communication topologies. To solve this problem, a distributed fuzzy fault-tolerant controller is proposed for each follower by adaptive mechanisms to track the state of the leader. Furthermore, the fuzzy logic system is utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics. An error estimator is introduced between the mismatched parameter matrix and the input matrix. Then, a selective adaptive law with relative state information is adopted and applied. When calculating the Lyapunov function';s derivative, the coupling terms related to consensus error and mismatched parameter uncertainties can be eliminated. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

Under the assumption that the topology is connected and every agent receives neighbors'; information with time-varying communication delay, consensus gains are designed without the precise information of delay. By researching the joint effects of agent dynamics, network topology, and time delay, conditions guaranteeing consensus are obtained for scalar systems and vector systems with a single unstable pole. In particular, in the case of first-order integrator systems, any large yet bounded delay is tolerant for weighted average consensus. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to show the effectiveness of the theoretical result.

49|8023325|Conference Paper|2017|F. Baghbani|Cooperative adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems|Here, we present a distributed adaptive control scheme for cooperative tracking of a class of nonlinear multiagent systems with partially unknown dynamics. The agents should reach an agreement on a time-varying reference trajectory as their virtual leader. The approach combines the artificial potential functions method with robust control terms to reach an appropriate controller for each agent. The unknown dynamics of each agent is approximated by an adaptive fuzzy system, with adaptive laws derived from Lyapunov stability analysis. Theoretical analysis reveals that H≈ì performance criterion is satisfied and the effects of uncertainties are kept below a desired attenuation level. The proposed method is applied to the state tracking problem of five inverted pendulums. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling noise and bounded uncertainties as well as reaching consensus with high precision.

In the existence of the external disturbance, two types of the high-gain control laws with the uniform quantized relative state measurements for the bounded consensus problem of MASs are first discussed, respectively. Then, in order to save the limited network resources in a multi-agent network, the event-triggered quantized communication protocols are designed based on the first case to obtain the bounded consensus in multi-agent systems. Moreover, it is shown that ‚ÄúZeno behavior‚Äù phenomenon can be excluded under the two event-triggered quantized control mechanisms, and the boundness of the relative state error can be adjusted by selecting the different parameters. Finally, two examples are shown to validate the feasibility and efficiency of our theoretical analysis.

It is assumed that only relative state or output measurements of the neighbors are available for each agent and only a part of the followers have access to the information of the dynamic leader. When relative state measurements are available, a bounded distributed finite-time coordinated tracking controller is proposed for each follower based on sliding mode control techniques.

Then a distributed finite-time coordinated tracking controller is designed based on the estimated relative state. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.

49|8592732|Conference Paper|2018|J.A. Guerrero|Forced Bipartite Consensus for Multi-Agent Systems|This paper addresses the problem of forced bipartite consensus on multi-agent systems (MAS) with application to quadrotor coordination. Opposite to standard consensus algorithms, the purpose of bipartite consensus is to divide the MAS into two groups or clusters. Resulting groups or clusters converge to the exact same solution with opposite sign, i.e. agents in the same group find a consensus or agreement while clusters, between them, get to a disagreed consensus. We extend the concept of multi-agent bipartite consensus to the case of forced bipartite consensus on leader-based multi-agent systems. Since tracking of a desired reference is based on the center of mass of the entire group, we analyze the controllability and observability properties from input and output of the leader. Quadrotor platoon switching behavior between coordination and danger avoidance shows a potential application of the proposed control approach. Results have been validated in simulation.

From the simulation results, it can be seen the proposed multi-agent system could perform the Smart Grid operation efficiently.
49|8929151|Conference Paper|2019|Jin Tanda|Cooperative Behavior by Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Abstractive Communication|Reinforcement learning (RL) is a major area of machine learning that aims to develop intelligent agents that are able to adapt in random environments appropriately. In this regard, RL has shown good results when applied to complex tasks such as playing video games. In addition, in multi-agent environments, RL has shown strong potential especially with the recent developments. However, there exist few studies that focus on developing cooperation among learning agents. In general, cooperative behavior among learning agents shows higher performance than independent agent behavior. Therefore, in this research, we focus on the cooperative behavior on Predator-Prey game in a continuous space, which is widely used as one of the typical simulation of Multi-agent environment. Especially we focus on predators that their goal is to catch a prey. We propose Leader-Follower model as the organization of predators, and investigate how they cooperate with each other to achieve their goal considering the prey';s policy using a model of RL. The results of our work indicate that a communication between Leader and Followers affects high performance. In addition, we acquire an interesting result as a process of achieving their goal. We investigate the movement locus of them in three cases which is different reward settings, and in each case, they take different policy depending on the reward. We visualize the movement of locus, and discuss about their cooperation and effectiveness.

This framework integrates the specialty agents (contractor agent, designer agent, supplier agent, owner agent) and service agents (coordinator agent, monitor agent, name server agent) into a multi-agent system through the Internet. Since different members in the construction supply chain have different preferences on the decision attributes (such as cost, time, quality, safety and environment), a multi-attribute negotiation mechanism is established by constructing the multi-attribute negotiation model, describing the multi attribute negotiation process, and designing the multi-attribute negotiation protocol. The establishment of this mechanism for construction supply chain coordination is based on negotiation theory and utility theory and aimed at promoting the coordination between specialty agents in it. Finally, the prototype system is developed by using a multi-agent system development environment. The experiment indicates that can solve problems in the construction supply chain operation and provides a solution to supply chain coordination in construction.

In centralized architecture with single middle agent, the middle agent itself is a bottleneck and suffers from single point failure; middle agents in distributed architecture lack capability of dynamic organization of agents; The reliability is not strong because of the single point failure and lack of effective architecture. We introduce a platform with ring architectural model to solve all above problems. In the platform, multiple middle agents are dynamically supported for solving the first problem. For solving the second problem, middle agents dynamically manage the registration and cancellation of service provider agents and application teams, each of which includes a set of closely interacting requester agents to complete an independent task. Redundancy middle agent technique is proposed for solving the third problem. All middle agents are of the feature of proliferation and self-cancellation according to the sensory inputs from their environment. For organizing the middle agents effectively, a ring architectural model is proposed. We demonstrate the applicability of the platform by its application and present experimental evidence that the platform is flexible and robust.
49|7810007|Conference Paper|2016|Nurzeatul Hamimah Abdul Hamid|Norms trust evaluation for norm adoption in open normative multi-agent systems|Norms are dynamic entities that exist in open multi-agent systems to control agents'; behavior. For norms to be effective in a domain, agents must first detect the norms'; existence. Recent works in this area have proposed mechanisms to endow agents with a norm detection capability. However, existing works in norms detection entail agents to consider only one norm in a particular event. In reality, one event may have more than one set of norms existing in a domain. In a more recent study, a norm detection mechanism reports that more than one norm can co-exist in a society. Thus, we argue that the existing approaches do not help agents to decide which norms to adopt in cases of multiple norms. To solve this problem, we propose the concept of norms trust to help agents to decide which detected norms are trustable from a set of norms that exist in an environment. The proposed trust-based norms evaluation consists of two-tier assessment; a credible agent evaluation that involves the task of evaluating the neighboring agents'; trust and a norms trust evaluation which is the aggregation of norm adoption ratio, norm adoption risk, and norms salience. The evaluation framework is then reinforced with a working scenario to illustrate the process.
49|7260783|Conference Paper|2015|Jinsha Li|Quantized consensus for nonlinear multi-agent system based on edge Laplacian|In this paper, a consensus problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems is considered in the presence of quantized measurement. The dynamic of each agent is first-order linearly parameterized system with non-identical unknown parameter. It is known that the consensus problem for linear multi-agent systems can be solved based on node state information, and equivalent results can be obtained via edge Laplancian approach. However, such an ‚Äúequivalent phenomenon‚Äù does not necessarily apply to nonlinear multi-agent systems with quantized measurement. Thus, to overcome the problem, we will explore the utility of edge Laplacian for designing adaptive consensus protocol with quantized state information. The results of this work will show that the edge Laplacian provides a new perspective for the control design. In addition, some interesting results based on the information of tree edges of the graph is proposed to apply the adaptive consensus protocol for nonlinear multi-agent systems with quantized information. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in this article.

By integrating impulsive control theory with event-triggered mechanism, a new hybrid event-triggered impulsive consensus protocol is presented, under which the information transmission of agents occurs at a sequence of state-dependent instants. Based on Lyapunov method, several quasi-consensus criteria of uncertain multi-agent systems are constructed, as well as the relation among control gains, event parameters, consensus error level, and convergence rate is established. It shows that the hybrid event-triggered control strategy benefits to save the energy cost of information transmission and control cost between agents compared with the time-triggered scheme, and it is effective to achieve quasi-consensus tracking objective of considered systems. Finally, the Zeno behavior is shown to be ruled out, and some simulation examples are proposed to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical analysis.
49|1245132|Conference Paper|2003|T. Kawamura|A logic-based framework for mobile multi-agent systems|We present a Prolog-based framework for building mobile multi-agent systems. In this framework, a new concept called &#034;field&#034; is introduced. A field provides data and procedures which are written in forms of Prolog program. An agent can &#034;enter&#034; into a field. Multiple agents can enter into one field, and the data and procedures of the field are shared by the agents. Therefore, agents in a field can communicate with each other through the field. Furthermore, a field is located on a computer in a network, and an agent entering in a field migrate to a computer on which the field locate automatically. An implementation of this framework has been built on a Java environment. Example programs running on our system are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

49|858522|Conference Paper|2000|R. Vincent|Experiences in simulating multi-agent systems using TAEMS|As researchers in multi-agent systems, we hope to build, deploy, and most importantly evaluate multi-agent systems in real, open environments. Unfortunately, working in such environments usually implies we expend significant energy on resolving issues orthogonal to the initial goals of the research, such as dealing with the knowledge engineering and low-level system integration issues. To avoid such overhead many researchers choose to implement, test and evaluate their multi-agent systems in a simulated world. In addition to providing a better-defined and predictable debugging environment, a good simulator can also help evaluate and quantify aspects of multi-agent system and multi-agent coordination in a controlled environment through repeated experiments. We report on experiences in simulating multi-agent systems using TAEMS. TAEMS is a task modeling language that can be used to represent agent activities. It models planned actions, candidate activities, and alternative solution paths from a quantified perspective, by using a task decomposition tree. In this design, the root nodes of the structure, or task groups, represent goals the agent can achieve. Internal nodes, or tasks, represent sub-goals and provide the organizational structure for primitive executable methods, which reside at the leaves of the tree. Each method is characterized along three dimensions: quality, which the agent hopes to maximize, cost, which the agent tries to minimize, and duration, which describes the time required to executing the method. The dimensions themselves are discrete distributions, so each probability/value pair represents a potential result for the characteristic in question.

With the electric power equipment increasingly intelligentized, the urge problem for the present electric power systems is how to realize the interaction between corresponding controllers and how to deal with the coordination between these control systems. Based on agent technique, this paper constructs a systematic structure of intelligent bodies of multi-control system and describes the application to solve the problem of control coordination with such structure, which provides a new idea to solve the problems of coordination between each control system in electric power systems.

Utatani|A multi-agent approach to outage work scheduling for electric power system|This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to power system switching operations in normal states. The proposed multi-agent system consists of several facilitator-agents (FAGS), equipment-agents (EAGs) and switch-box-agents (SBAGs). FAG acts as a manager for negotiation process between agents. EAG corresponds to an equipment of the electric power system such as a bus, a transformer and a transmission line, while SBAG is a pseudo-object which consists of neighboring circuit breakers and disconnecting switches. The proposed multi-agent system realizes appropriate switching operations by interacting with neighboring agents. Computer tests on a model system show that the proposed approach is effective and promising.

Then the camera in our system has inherited the agent';s characteristics to be a camera-agent, which is not only execute the actions of object detection and tracking, but also get its knowledge by knowing about itself and the surrounding environment. What';s more, the camera-agents can collaborate with each other through agents'; communication mechanism to improve global cooperation of our system.

50|8866545|Conference Paper|2019|Lixin Gao|Weighted Consensus Problem for Multi-agent Systems|In this paper, the concept of consensus is generalized to weighted consensus, by which the bipartite consensus and cluster consensus problems can be unified in the proposed weighted consensus frame. The dynamics of agents are modeled by the general continuous-time linear systems. The interaction topology is modeled by edge- and node-weighted directed graphs. Under both state feedback and output feedback control strategies, the weighted consensus problems are transformed into the equivalent conventional consensus problems. Then, a distributed state feedback protocol and an output feedback protocol are proposed to solve the weighted consensus problems respectively. Finally, a simple example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.
50|5945725|Conference Paper|2011|Sara Maalal|A model design of multi-agent systems|This study falls within the framework of agent-oriented software engineering, process design methodologies and development of a MAS. In our approach, we try to describe a generic and scalable method of a MAS with a component-oriented architecture and agent-based approach that allows MDA to generate source code from a given model. We begin by designing class diagrams of different agents of a MAS on AUML. Then we generate the source code of the models developed using an open source tool called AndroMDA. This agent-based and evolutive approach enhances the modularity and genericity developments and promotes their reusability in future developments. This property distinguishes our design methodology of existing methodologies in that it is constrained by any particular agent-based model while providing a library of generic models.

By introducing a double-dynamics analysis (DDA) approach, the boundedness is ensured for the state and input of all agents such that a ‚Äúquasi-globally‚Äù Lipschitz nonlinear condition can be established for the locally Lipschitz nonlinear multi-agent systems. This is further adopted to exploit the convergence of distributed ILC in order to achieve a perfect formation control of all agents. A simulation example is given to illustrate our ILC-based formation results and also the effectiveness of our DDA approach to convergence analysis of nonlinear ILC.

The communication network we consider is a signed graph, which consists of both positive and negative edges, representing collaboration and competition interactions, respectively.

Based on event triggering mechanism, group consensus schemes are developed for both cases of fixed and switching network topologies. It is shown that multi-agent systems can achieve group consensus under the proposed consensus protocols. Moreover, the proposed protocols can be reduced to purely decentralized ones when there exists only one leader agent in a multi-agent system. Under the decentralized event-triggered control laws, we can obtain similar results as those of the case of multi leader agents. Finally, simulation results are given to validate the theoretical results.

This paper presents a generic CPPS (cyber-physical production system) architecture that copes with SMEs specific challenges and simplifies the implementation of the Industry 4.0 paradigm in real world applications. The proposed CPPS architecture has been validated in an industrial pilot application. The COSMIXER-CPPS is able to control devices with different interfaces and protocols as well as to communicate with external databases and web-services. The unified communication middleware within the CPPS enables furthermore the reconfiguration and scaling of the system with minimal disruption. This research is a contribution to reduce inhibitions towards the implementation of Industry 4.0 in SMEs, further research has to be carried out to investigate and enhance the dependability, security, real-time capability and performance of SME-friendly CPPS.
50|6802553|Conference Paper|2014|Ahmad Esmaeili|Multi-level holonification of multi-agent networks|A networked multi-agent system is a group of intelligent agents structured in a social network induced by agent interactions. As the size and diversity of the multi-agent system increase, the interactions and mutual influence of the agents in the structure become more complicated, and this makes the coordination of the system hard to deal with. Holonic models for multi-agent systems have been considered as one of promising models to manage large scale problems. This paper tackles one of the key problems in the design of holonic multi-agent systems. Here we propose a method to construct a multi-level holonic structure for a multi-agent network based on the centrality of the agents. The proposed method is applied to an urban traffic problem and the evaluation results prove its effectiveness.

Different from the previous results on the multi-agent systems with unknown dead-zone, the dead-zone nonlinear is researched in the output channel. By using the recursive backstepping design method and the universal approximation ability of fuzzy logic systems, a local controller for each follower is constructed. Meanwhile, a Lyapunov-based logic switching rule is applied to handle the unknown control gain problems aroused by the output dead-zone nonlinearities. It is, thus, shown that the established adaptive control protocol can assure the finite-time state synchronization of each node. Besides, the state synchronization error between any adjacent followers also converges to a small region of zero when time tends to $T_{0}$ . Finally, the two simulations are conducted to further verify our theoretical results.

The control objective is to ensure that a group of agents reaches a formation characterized by external time-varying parameters. First, a translation control design is presented to stabilize the multi-agent system to a circular motion tracking a time-varying center. Then, we propose a new framework based on affine transformations to extend previous results to more complex time-varying formations. Moreover, both control laws are improved adding a cooperative term to distribute the agents uniformly along the formation.
50|9160943|Journal Article|2020|Meijia Wang|An Organizational Structure and Self-Adaptive Mechanism for Holonic Multi-Agent Systems|A holonic multi-agent system combines the concept of a holon with a multi-agent system; this combination has been proven to be an effective way to build a complex system. Great progress has been made in this area, but previous studies are fragmented and lack of a task-based perspective to model different systems in the real world. Therefore, this article proposes a formalistic model for HMAS from a task-based perspective. Not only the static organizational structure is designed, but also the dynamic running mechanism, including the self-adaptive mechanism and the task assignment mechanism based on the proposed holonic structure, are also discussed. Finally, a case study is provided to verify the self-adaptive mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed DHMAS has the ability to adapt to the changing environment, and performs better in terms of the success rate and the response time when the system is heavily loaded.

For the purpose of this case study, we adopt a multi-agent coordination, which uses the recursive modeling method (RMM) that enables an agent to select his rational action by examining with other agents by modeling their decision making in a distributed multi-agent environment. Bayesian learning is used in conjunction with RMM for belief update. As a result, an agent can determine which models of the other agents are correct, and keep his knowledge up to date. We describe how decision making using RMM and Bayesian learning is applied to the urban traffic control domain to settle a multi-agent traffic control system and show experimental results.

We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential asymptotic consensus based on the classical theory of complete observability. The proof is remarkably simple compared to similar results in the literature and the conditions for consensus are mild. This observability-based method can also be applied to the case where negatively weighted edges are present. Additionally, as a by-product of the observability based arguments, we show that the nodes'; initial value can be recovered from the signals on the edges up to a shift of the network average.

Based on this hybrid model, we present how to construct Lypaunov function, and the decentralized event-triggering conditions design is also developed. An application example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The individual local cost is formulated and a control solution for each agent is derived considering an inverse optimal control approach. To address the interaction between the agents, a coordination method based on a non-cooperative game is proposed. Using Lyapunov and Input-to-State Stability (ISS) arguments, we derive conditions under which the proposed game converges to a fixed point and the overall multi-agent system is ISS with respect to the disturbance signals. Simulation results for a coupled pendula system are presented.

Each agent can only use its own and neighbors'; information to design its control input. To attenuate the communication noises, a distributed stochastic approximation type protocol is used. By using probability limit theory and algebraic graph theory, consensus conditions for this kind of protocols are obtained: (A) For the case of fixed topologies, a necessary and sufficient condition for mean square average-consensus is given, which is also sufficient for almost sure consensus. (B) For the case of time-varying topologies, sufficient conditions for mean square average-consensus and almost sure consensus are given, respectively. Especially, if the network switches between jointly-containing-spanning-tree, instantaneously balanced graphs, then the designed protocol can guarantee that each individual state converges, both almost surely and in mean square, to a common random variable, whose expectation is right the average of the initial states of the whole system, and whose variance describes the static maximum mean square error between each individual state and the average of the initial states of the whole system.

51|6625463|Conference Paper|2013|Isamu Shioya|Resource utilization of stochastic mobile multi-agents|This paper describes how to coordinate autonomous mobile multi-agents, whose agents stochastically move over a finite resource consisting of cells in accordance with transition probabilities. We assume that (1) each agent can not move to a destination cell occupied by agents more than the agents of a current cell and (2) their agents have time-lag. Then it is ideal that every cells are always occupied by agents, because of the efficient use of resources, and it is desirable to be the fewest expected number of cells not occupied by agents. The first result shows that the resource utilization of accelerated mobile multi-agents with appropriate average moving speed becomes higher than the resource utilization of mobile multi-agents without average moving speed. Then the resource utilization can be accelerated to maximum by giving appropriate moving speed. The second result shows that there are the best moving speed of system-specific optimum to utilize the resources of autonomous stochastic mobile multi-agents.

Lo|A Multi-Agent Based Service Restoration in Distribution Network with Distributed Generations|The amount of distributed generation (DG) integrations in the distribution network is increasing. In order to enhance the service reliability, intentional islanding operation and coordinated operations of DG with supporting feeders can be considered to assist service restoration during fault. This paper presents a multi-agent based fault restoration system with and without DG assistance and compares its performance with centralized processing scheme. Network simulation results indicate that for fault detection, isolation and service restoration, a multi-agent system could outperform the centralized processing system. Equipped with adequate synchronizing equipment in the distribution system, coordinated operations of DG and supporting feeders could minimize the un-served load during fault.

The result also indicates the importance of recognition of uncontrollable topology structures.

The finite-time command filter is used to overcome the explosion of complexity problem and the established fractional power based error compensation signal is applied to compensate the filtering error caused by the filter. The distributed finite-time command filtered backstepping control method combines with the neural adaptive control technology and state observer is given, which ensures the containment control errors reach to the desired neighborhood of the origin in finite-time in the presence of uncertain dynamics and unmeasurable states in the system. The given numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

51|7164817|Conference Paper|2015|Swati Aggarwal|Modelling of hierarchical location management schemes to locate mobile multi agents using colored Petri Net|Mobile Agent (MA) is software works on behalf of user with the ability to migrate from one host to another under its own control in the open network like internet. For some applications, group of mobile agents are launched in place of single MA, these MAs interact with each other to know the status of other MAs and to communicate with them. When a MA is launched, its discoverer has no control over the MA and doesn';t know about its location until it comes back to the discoverer after completing its route. In order to communicate with MAs its location must be traced and an appropriate communication mechanism must be used. The major operating cost associated with location management is the large MA cost to search and update. This paper presents a solution to locate MA in a global network for multi agent environment. Proposed solution divides the global network into regions and then combines search and update based techniques to locate MA. This paper identifies the various components of the proposed scheme and models them using Coloured Petri Net (CPN) tool. Once the model is build, various tools offered by CPN are used to check the correctness of the modelled system.
51|5477615|Conference Paper|2010|He Luo|Multi agent negotiation model for distributed task allocation|In the multi agent system, negotiation between different agents becomes more and more complex when the distributed tasks need to be allocated among them. Usually, this process has been done in the centralized way where agents have all the information of both the tasks and the environment. However, in the real application such as satellite scheduling problem or production scheduling problem, not all the information can be acquired, some of them even cannot be known. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi agent negotiation model for distributed task allocation in a priority based environment. This process is modeled as a finite Markov Decision Process (F-MDP), and a coordinated negotiation protocol is also suggested to support the model. The experiments show that tasks are allocated in an efficient way, and it can also reduce the communication cost.

 optimal controller. Finally, the controllers with the same structure are obtained to achieve the performance improvement of the whole systems. The advantages of the proposed approach are that the design procedure is conducted analytically and a simple quantitative tuning way is developed to trade off the nominal performance and robustness. The simulation results show the effectiveness of this method.
51|7047745|Journal Article|2015|Yuan Fan|Self-Triggered Consensus for Multi-Agent Systems With Zeno-Free Triggers|In this technical note, a self-triggered consensus algorithm for multi-agent systems has been proposed. Each agent receives the state information of its neighbors and computes the average state of its neighborhood. Based on this average state the event trigger is designed to determine when the agent updates its control input and transmits the average state to its neighbors. By specifying a strictly positive minimal inter-event time for each agent, Zeno behavior can be avoided. Then by solving quadratic equations related to the event condition, the self-triggered consensus algorithm is developed by directly computing the event time instants with a set of iterative procedures. It has been proved that with the proposed ‚ÄúZeno-free‚Äù algorithm the agent group can achieve consensus asymptotically. Compared with the existing works, the proposed algorithm is simpler in formulation and computation. Moreover, it has been showed that agents need less time to achieve consensus with considerable reduction of the number of triggering events, controller updates and information transmission. As a result, more energy can be saved using the proposed algorithm in practical multi-agent systems.

51|7169529|Journal Article|2016|Zhixin Liu|Synchronization of a Group of Mobile Agents With Variable Speeds Over Proximity Nets|This paper focuses on the synchronization analysis of a class of multiagent systems, where both speed and heading of each agent depend on the states of its local neighbors. The neighbors are defined through the distance between agents and all agents are interconnected via proximity nets. In the variable speed model, the speed of each agent depends on the polarization order of its neighbors in a power-law manner, and the heading is updated according to the average heading of its neighbors. Therefore, the speeds, headings, and positions of all agents are strongly coupled together. For the uniformly and independently distributed initial states, we provide sufficient conditions, imposed only on model parameters, to guarantee synchronization of the variable speed model in the following two cases: 1) the maximum speed and the neighborhood radius are fixed constants and 2) the maximum speed and the neighborhood radius are changing with the population size. Our results reveal that the permitted maximum speed in the variable speed model can be larger than that in the relevant constant speed model.

The focus is on the DG agents - the distributed energy resources (DERs), load, storage and the grid agents - and the Mu agent which acts as the communication channel between the DG agents to the higher level agents such as the control agent. The design philosophy incorporates the core features of an MAS that are required to monitor and control a rural Indian microgrid. The system has been compacted and design simplified, since only relevant parameters from a rural Indian MG are considered. The Arduino system obtains the inputs from the various DG agents which are then channeled to the D agent after appropriate processing. The implementation of the system has been done using an Arduino microcontroller.

P2P systems are characterized by decentralization, scalability and dynamicity, such that they can been seen as instances of complex adaptive systems (CAS). In this paper we present ant-based load balancing algorithm, which effectively balances loads of peers distributed among P2P systems with the help of autonomous agents called Ants. Ants search a pair of overloaded and underloaded nodes through wandering on network and transfer tasks from different overloaded nodes to different underloaded nodes simultaneously. It is assumed that time break that ants spend on searching a pair of overloaded, underloaded node and transfer of virtual servers between them is negligible. The algorithm developed increases response time of submitted jobs and decreases communication overhead by load transfer in terms of virtual servers between overloaded and underloaded nodes simultaneously.
51|7206541|Journal Article|2016|Xiaotai Wu|Distributed Consensus of Stochastic Delayed Multi-agent Systems Under Asynchronous Switching|In this paper, the distributed exponential consensus of stochastic delayed multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics is investigated under asynchronous switching. The asynchronous switching considered here is to account for the time of identifying the active modes of multi-agent systems. After receipt of confirmation of mode';s switching, the matched controller can be applied, which means that the switching time of the matched controller in each node usually lags behind that of system switching. In order to handle the coexistence of switched signals and stochastic disturbances, a comparison principle of stochastic switched delayed systems is first proved. By means of this extended comparison principle, several easy to verified conditions for the existence of an asynchronously switched distributed controller are derived such that stochastic delayed multi-agent systems with asynchronous switching and nonlinear dynamics can achieve global exponential consensus. Two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper deals with distributed real-time control of crossings in a railway system. The current adopted software engineering techniques (e.g. artificial intelligence) are not able to couple with real-time constraints due to its nature undeterministic behavior.

51|8250942|Conference Paper|2017|Venkatraman Renganathan|Spoof resilient coordination for distributed multi-robot systems|As cyber-physical networks become increasingly equipped with embedded sensing, communication, computation, and actuation capabilities, they are made vulnerable to malicious attacks by increasing the number of access points which are available for attackers. A particularly pernicious attack is spoofing, in which a malicious agent spawns multiple identities or impersonates legitimate agents to gain a disproportionate advantage. Spoofing attacks can easily compromise otherwise attack-resilient algorithms and network structures that assume an upper bound on the number of malicious agents in the network. We generalize a class of resilient consensus strategies, known as Weighted Mean-Subsequence-Reduced (W-MSR) consensus, to further provide spoof resilience by incorporating a physical fingerprint analysis of signals received from neighboring agents. By comparing the physical fingerprints of received signals, legitimate agents can identify and isolate malicious agents that attempt spoofing attacks. We quantify the effects of delays in detecting spoofing and inexact detection due to noise in the received signals. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our framework is applicable to a variety of problems involving multi-robot systems coordinating via wireless communication, including coverage, distributed estimation, and formation control.

The numerical examples are provided to illustrate the correctness of the results.

We first introduce a type of distributed internal model to convert the cooperative global robust output regulation problem into a global robust stabilization problem of a so-called augmented multi-agent system which is in the block lower triangular form. We then further show that, under a set of standard assumptions, the augmented multi-agent system can be globally stabilized via a distributed state feedback control law by developing a block backstepping technique. A special case of the main result of this paper leads to the solution of the leader-following global robust consensus problem for a class of nonlinear uncertain multi-agent systems.
52|4258901|Conference Paper|2007|Keinosuke Matsumoto|A Dependable System Considering Interdependence Between Agents|A multiagent system (MAS) has recently gained public attention as a method to solve competition and cooperation in distributed systems. However, MAS';s vulnerability due to the propagation of failure prevents from applying to large-scale system. This paper proposes a general composition method to improve its reliability easily applied to existent MASs. The method monitors messages between agents to detect undesirable behaviors such as failure. Collecting the information, the method generates global information of interdependence between agents and expresses it in a graph. This interdependence graph enables us to detect or predict undesirable behaviors. This paper also shows that the method can optimize performance of MAS and improve its reliability under complicated and dynamic environment by applying the global information acquired from the interdependence graph to a replication system.

A distributed protocol, which contains a designed signal to dominate the effects of unmodeled dynamics, is proposed to solve the consensus problem for the nonlinear multi-agent systems.

Then the result is extended to the case when topologies are directed, where any communication graph only contains a spanning tree with the root vertex being the leader agent. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.

Complete requirements of the user cannot be perceived at a given point of time. The reason is that they evolve with time, mostly they are observed after the system deployment. This evolutionary nature of user';s requirements poses difficulties in almost every phase of software development process of any project. The work of this paper gives an approach to overcome this problem. In this paper, the software intelligent agents are proposed for hospital environment. Algorithms of each agent is also proposed and implemented. These agents are automated in gathering user requirements and automatically evolve over time after deployment of the software. The evolving nature of agents helps agent based systems to enhance automatically their capabilities according to the user ever changing behavior. The intelligent agent is applied in hospital management system (HMS). Four agents and their algorithms has been proposed and implemented that gathers requirements of the user that are related to HMS after deployment of HMS software. Four agents for hospital environment are Patient Agent, Doctor Agent, Nurse Agent and Environment Agent.

How to allocate these resources efficiently is critical in proceeding of cooperation and competition in multi-agent system. This paper proposes and investigates an approach to solve the problem by introducing auction theory from economics game. An agent-based multi-item auction model is studied as negotiation method so as to get some precious resources for buyer agents and allocate them for vendor agent. Some properties and impacts of agents'; parameters are shown through simulating experience such as buying power, item number required by buyer agent, number of buyer agents, rules of auction and so on. All this is key and beneficial for the future mechanisms design both in agent-based software engineering and various distributed system, especially Internet-based commerce applications.

52|9037246|Journal Article|2021|Dhrubajit Chowdhury|Practical Synchronization in Networks of Nonlinear Heterogeneous Agents With Application to Power Systems|In this article, we consider the synchronization problem in a network of nonlinear multiagent systems having the same relative degree r. The agents do not have access to their state or output and only have relative output information from their neighbors. The controller structure is decentralized in nature and, therefore, depends only on the relative information available to it. The agent dynamics are transformed into relative dynamics by a change of coordinates where the agent dynamics are coupled. Extended high-gain observers are used to estimate the nonlinear coupling at each agent and then cancel them using feedback control. Therefore, the problem changes to a stabilization problem of N nonlinear systems in the relative coordinates. It is shown that the agents achieve practical synchronization and the synchronization error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the high-gain observer parameter. Finally, simulations are done with a network of power systems to show the efficacy of the proposed controller.
52|6967745|Journal Article|2015|Kazunori Sakurama|Distributed Controllers for Multi-Agent Coordination Via Gradient-Flow Approach|This paper provides a unified solution for a general distributed control problem of multi-agent systems based on the gradient-flow approach. First, a generalized coordination is presented as a control objective which represents a wide range of coordination tasks (e.g., consensus, formation and pattern decision) in a unified manner. Second, a necessary and sufficient condition for the gradient-based controllers to be distributed is derived. It turns out that the notion of clique (i.e., complete subgraph) plays a crucial role to obtain any distributed controllers. Furthermore, all such controllers are explicitly characterized with free design parameters. Third, it is shown how to choose an optimal controller in a systematic way among all distributed ones, where an optimality measure is introduced for the generalized coordination. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations, where a distributed pattern decision is discussed as an example of the generalized coordination.
52|7426924|Conference Paper|2015|Abdelhay Haqiq|Towards an approach for behavioral specification of reactive multi-agent system|Reactive Multi-Agent system (RMAS) has emerged as an attractive technology for the design and implementation of distributed and cooperative systems. The RMAS main challenge is how to clearly identify its local and global behavior. Several approaches have been introduced to deal with behavioral specification of RMAS. However, there is a lack in the specification and verification process that facilitates understanding the system from goals identification that the system expects to achieve to formal verification of system properties. In this paper, we are interested to the specification problem of Reactive Multi-Agent System (RMAS) for both individual and collective behavior by taking into account two modes of specification: normal mode and fault-tolerance mode. To do so, we propose a method called BECAMEDA (Behavioral SpEcification and VerifiCAtion of RMAS based on E-MDRA) for the specification and verification of reactive Multi-agent system based on the MDRA (Multi-Decisional Reactive Agent) models. The MDRA specifies the reactive agent behavior by highlighting the decisional aspect of the agent. The BECAMEDA method will be described throughout an example of Car Crisis Management.

Here we will improve the Coleman model of trust. We believe that only if one agent is in the trustworthy group can the other agents trust it. In this paper, we mainly devote ourselves to the work of management of agents according to their reputation: we take advantage ofFNHMS (Fuzzy Non- homogeneous Markov System) to model the agent system, during which three population parameters and two basic parameters are defined to deduce the transition probabilities matrix, so lastly we can simulate the change of the scale of trustworthy agents and know the whole distribution of agents about their reputation. Finally our experimental results prove that the theoretical results are true, and our improvement of the Coleman model of trust is fit and reasonable.

In this paper, we survey the AOP researches from three aspects: programming concepts and models, programming constructs and languages, programming tools and environments, which are indispensable as a programming paradigm in software engineering. We also analyze the weaknesses of current AOP researches from software engineering viewpoint and discuss future work.

The interaction of several simple agents leads to a dynamic system, allowing efficient approximation of a solution. Simulation results have demonstrated that this method is able to reach sub-optimal target network configurations.

53|8105616|Conference Paper|2017|Ryo Toyota|Formation control of multi-agent system considering obstacle avoidance|This paper deals with distributed and cooperative control algorithm to make each agents to form a formation for a second-order system. However, when forming a formation with a multi-agent system, there is a possibility that the agents collide with each other or collide with obstacles other than the agent. Also, if the agents avoid other agents and obstacles, the distance between agents may be temporarily too far apart. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a control algorithm which consists of Leader-Follower structure, consensus algorithm and artificial force based on artificial potential field. For the control algorithm to make agents achieve formation in a decentralized cooperative way, we derive the condition concerning the control gain to ensure stability. In addition, by comparing the amount of energy, we design conditions that ensure collision avoidance between agents, collision avoidance with obstacles, and distance between agents, and also design potential functions that satisfy the conditions. The validity of the control algorithm proposed in this paper is verified by numerical simulations.

Weerawardhana|Web service based model for inter-agent communication in multi-agent systems: A case study|Service oriented architecture (SOA) is a widely used model for enterprise application integration, mainly due to the presence of accepted standards and tools required to implement web services. While the service oriented architecture provides an elegant model for interoperability, it does not define a computational model for building the endpoints of complex distributed services it exposes in a typical enterprise application. On the other hand, software agent technology provides powerful models such as the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model that allows developers to build distributed systems with enhanced reasoning capabilities. We propose a web services based communication model for inter-agent communication allowing heterogeneous agents in a multi agent system to freely collaborate. We specifically focus on goal and beliefset sharing in BDI based agents. By providing a web services based interface, we allow agents as well as non-agent based services in a distributed system to yield the benefits of agent technology. Applicability of this proposition is demonstrated by designing and implementing a prototype multi-agent system for flood forecasting.

To do so, we introduce a framework for agent systems based on a formal language model -grammar systems theory- that is inspired by one of the most common forms of interaction: conversation. Our multi-agent system model belongs to the interaction-level category of agent technologies. It offers an environment-based model for multi-agent systems, since it formally defines a multi-agent system that explicitly specifies how an agent interacts with its environment.

In contrast to the traditional complete formation, where only one formation is realized by the multi-agent system, in the group formation, there could be multiple sub-formations. Firstly, a time-varying group formation protocol is constructed using local relative positions and velocities of each agent and its neighbors. Then based on graph theory, nonsingular transformations are applied to the closed-loop multi-agent systems. Sufficient conditions for second-order multi-agent systems to achieve time-varying group formation are further presented together with the time-varying group formation feasibility constraints. Explicit expressions of the subgroup formation reference functions are derived to describe the macroscopic movement of the time-varying subgroup formations. Moreover, by solving an algebraic Riccati equation, an approach to design the time-varying group formation protocol is proposed. Finally, a numerical example with three subgroups is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

As multiple robots are assigned to explore different locations, they may interfere each other making the overall tasks less efficient. In this paper, we present a new model called CNN-based Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (CMAPPO) to multi-agent exploration wherein the agents learn the effective strategy to allocate and explore the environment using a new deep reinforcement learning architecture. The model combines convolutional neural network to process multi-channel visual inputs, curriculum-based learning, and PPO algorithm for motivation based reinforcement learning. Evaluations show that the proposed method can learn more efficient strategy for multiple agents to explore the environment than the conventional frontier-based method.
53|6570579|Conference Paper|2013|Abdellah Kouider El Ouahed|A Discovery Service for Automatic Composition of Web Services Oriented-Agent|In this paper we present an approach for automatic web service composition. The process of composition considered includes two layers; the discovery layer which aims to generate a composition schema, and the execution layer which uses a multi-agent system to select web services and execute the composite service. The main focus of this work is on the discovery layer where we propose an approach to optimize the search of the composite service. Firstly, a dependency graph is created by matching the I/O parameters of request and all available web services in register. Then a backward search is performed on this graph to choose the composition schema. The principle used for choosing services is based on the proportion of input and output parameters. Services with the highest proportion are preferred, allowing us to minimize the number of services participating in the solution. Experimentation and performance evaluation of the suggested approach are given at the end of this paper.

53|8870934|Conference Paper|2019|Cassandra McCord|Distributed Progressive Formation Control for Multi-Agent Systems: 2D and 3D deployment of UAVs in ROS/Gazebo with RotorS|Coordination of multiple robots in order to cooperatively perform a given task requires a certain distribution of the different units in space. Furthermore, individual robots, or agents, might have different tasks, or positions, assigned. Formation control algorithms might rely on a priori information, a centralized controller, or communication among the agents to assign roles. Distributed approaches that only need local interaction between agents have limited possibilities, such as flocks where agents actively control the distance to neighboring agents. Alternatively, two-way local communication has been applied to progressively assign roles and converge towards a given configuration. We propose a progressive assignment algorithm and formation control scheme that extends leader-follower formations in order to enable cooperation of multiple robots with minimal, one-way, local communication between agents. The proposed algorithm progressively generates a directed, locally convex, path graph to uniquely assign formation positions to all agents. The low computational complexity of our algorithm enables its implementation in resource-limited devices. Agents only require information about neighboring agents and be able to locally broadcast their status. This algorithm enables almost arbitrary two-dimensional configurations, with the only limitation being the sensing range enabling the definition of a series of convex hulls in a certain subset of agents such that agents sharing an edge in the hull are able to sense each other. Moreover, we propose a methodology for deploying agents to an arbitrary three-dimensional configuration after the assignment process is made on the plane.

Then we use this UIO to design a discontinuous controller which contains a consensus part and a discontinuous part, where the impacts of the leader‚Äôs unknown inputs can be completely removed by the discontinuous part. Furthermore, by using the average dwell time (ADT) method, we show that asymptotical consensus can be achieved if the ADT is larger than a positive threshold. Secondly, we design a continuous controller under which the consensus tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, we perform a simulation on the multiple Chua‚Äôs circuits to validate the theoretical result.

Every agent of the MAS has homogeneous dynamic function, which is described by a nonlinearly parameterized functions with unknown state time-delays. Moreover, it is assumed that the virtual leader (regarded as the desired trajectory) can be accessible to at least one agent.

The result of convergence analysis shows that the designed control strategy can guarantee the agents track virtual leader along the iteration axis. A numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the adaptive iterative learning controller.

Consequently, agent modeling faces several difficulties in development and implementation and has been continuously researched on the conceptualization of complex systems which are composed of several agents. Consequently, we introduced the concept of node (or the nodal approach) as a novel agent-based model that consists of a human, one or more agents and their corresponding functions that represent an intelligent entity. The instantiation of multiple nodes with diverse functions and workflow process could represent a domain in which humans interact with other humans via software agents to achieve some common goals. In this paper, we conduct a questionnaire survey to investigate on the generalized functions of humans and agents that are required for a node. A number of devices and media including Document, Email, Phone Call, SMS are selected to validate the proposed model. This paper presents the results of the survey that solicits information pertaining to the tasks performed by humans to determine generalized functions of humans and agents in a node.

In this paper, we design a low-gain based protocol for each agent such that the protocol output (agents'; inputs) can be squeezed enough and the saturation is not activated. Moreover, an upper bound of the input delay is obtained. This paper focuses on a class of agent systems, i.e. all agents'; eigenvalues are in the closed left half plane (that is at most unstable agents), and topology describing the coupling among agents is undirected, but weighed. The numerical results with six agents coupled with full states and partial states illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed protocol design.

Different from the previous work, the states of followers form a predefined time-varying formation while tracking the states of the leader with unknown but bounded control input. Besides, the dynamics of each agent is high-order and has nonlinearity. Firstly, a nonlinear time-varying formation tracking control protocol is proposed based on the distributed observer which is constructed using only local neighboring output information. Secondly, an algorithm with three steps is proposed to design the distributed observer-based formation tracking protocol, where the time-varying formation tracking feasibility condition is given. Thirdly, by using Lyapunov theory, the stability of the proposed algorithm is proven. Finally, a numerical example with three followers and one leader is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.
54|4770054|Conference Paper|2008|Yan-Hong Wang|Multi-Agent and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Approach for Distributed Jobshop Scheduling|Jobshop scheduling is a typical NP hard problem. In the distributed manufacturing environment, it becomes a more intractable one with the characters of distributed object, multiple target and strong dynamic. A novel distribution jobshop scheduling method based on multi-agent mechanism and genetic algorithm is presented. A distributed scheduling system framework, which composed of several jobshop agents, task agents, and resource agents, is established firstly. With the distribution of agents, the complex distributed scheduling problem is transformed into several sub-problems, such as local optimization scheduling of individual agent and global optimization of the multi-agent system. Then, a hybrid genetic algorithm is elaborated to support agents to do their scheduling decisions. In order to further improve capacities of the algorithm, a new solution is proposed, which allowing agents to participate in the optimizing process of the genetic algorithm. Finally, a prototype system for multi-shop distributed scheduling is developed and the simulation results are given to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the approach.

54|9007519|Journal Article|2020|Dongdong Yue|Distributed Neuro-Adaptive Formation Control for Uncertain Multi-Agent Systems: Node- and Edge-Based Designs|Distributed neuro-adaptive Time-Varying Formation (TVF) control for multi-agent systems with matching unknown nonlinearities is considered. According to different perspectives of the dynamical coupling strengths between the agents, two control strategies, named node- and edge-based, are designed and analyzed in the framework of Lyapunov theory, respectively. With the help of neural networks and nonsmooth analysis, both controllers guarantee the robust asymptotical convergence of the TVF errors and can also resist unknown matching disturbances. Node-based design is found to be fully-distributed, which does not depend on any global information, meanwhile the edge-based design is applicable for TVF on switching graphs. Some numerical simulations are provided to support the theoretical results.

First, two delay-dependent cycle dwell time switching laws are proposed for the first time. Second, by the proposed cyclic switching laws and constructed Lyapunov functionals, new leader-following consensus criteria for discrete-time multi-agent systems with time-varying delays are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Compared with the existing literature, the developed cyclic switching method not only greatly improves the upper bound of time-varying delays in the multi-agent system, but also gives the estimation of upper and lower bounds for dwell time of the system. Finally, some simulations for the leader-following consensus of multi-agent systems with time-varying delays are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme.
54|9424396|Journal Article|2021|Xiang-Gui Guo|Event-Triggered Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Pinning Control for Cluster Consensus of Heterogeneous Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Under Aperiodic DoS Attacks|This paper presents an event-triggered cluster consensus scheme for heterogeneous nonlinear second-order multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to cyber attacks (i.e., aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks), actuator faults and integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) under directed communication topology containing a directed spanning tree. Based on local communication, an event-triggered adaptive fault-tolerant pinning control scheme is designed to achieve cluster consensus under simultaneous cyber attacks and actuator faults. The proposed control scheme does not require the communication topology to satisfy the in-degree balance between different clusters. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant control part only needs to estimate one parameter for each agent. Instead of requiring continuous information on its neighbors to determine the trigger instants as in the previous literature, an event-triggered mechanism that does not require periodic sampling of neighbors'; information is developed to save network resources, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, a simulation example confirms the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.

55|4773028|Conference Paper|2008|N. A. Sabour|Multi-agent based framework for target tracking using a real time vision system|This paper presents a multi-agent based framework for target tracking. We exploit the agent-oriented software paradigm with its characteristics that provide intelligent autonomous behavior together with a real time computer vision system to achieve high performance real time target tracking. The framework consists of four layers; interface, strategic, management, and operation layers. Interface layer receives from the user the tracking parameters such as the number and type of trackers and targets and type of the tracking environment, and then delivers these parameters to the subsequent layers. Strategic (decision making) layer is provided with a knowledge base of target tracking methodologies that are previously implemented by researchers in diverse target tracking applications and are proven successful. And by inference in the knowledge base using the user input a tracking methodology is chosen. Management layer is responsible for pursuing and controlling the tracking methodology execution. Operation layer represents the phases in the tracking methodology and is responsible for communicating with the real-time computer vision system to execute the algorithms in the phases. The framework is presented with a case study to show its ability to tackle the target tracking problem and its flexibility to solve the problem with different tracking parameters. This paper describes the ability of the agent-based framework to deploy any real-time vision system that fits in solving the target tracking problem. It is a step towards a complete open standard, real-time, agent-based framework for target tracking.

55|725486|Conference Paper|1998|K. Chiba|Iterated continuous prisoner's dilemma game and its usefulness in analyzing multi-agent systems|In multi-agent systems, each agent has his own objective, sometimes conflicts with others, and there exists no supervisor which controls the entire system. The iterated prisoner';s dilemma game was studied as a model for analyzing interactions between agents under such situation. In this game, each agent chooses his action from ';Cooperate'; and ';Defect';, but this is unsatisfactory when we consider complex multi-agent systems such as cyberworlds. We extend this game so that each agent can take intermediate actions from the range between ';Cooperate'; and ';Defect';. The purpose of this research is to clarify the profitability of taking intermediate actions using the iterated prisoner';s dilemma game extended to a continuous domain, and to show the usefulness of this game in analyzing elastic interactions between agents. Several knowledge has been obtained as results of analysis. For example, a cooperative strategy taking intermediate actions invades a group of identical strategies taking discrete actions, and a group of cooperative strategies taking intermediate ones also. Note that being a cluster is less profitable in this case.
55|8595389|Conference Paper|2018|Sylvain Ductor|A Coordination Mechanism to Replicate Large-Scale Multi-agent Systems|Distributed cooperative applications are now increasingly designed as Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Such applications may be open, dynamic, large scale and exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic agents criticalities. These characteristics create new challenges to the traditional approaches of fault-tolerance. We focus on replication-based preventive approach. The aim is to dynamically and automatically adapt the agent replication strategy (number of replicas and their location), in order to maximize the MAS reliability (guarantee of continuity of computation w.r.t the agents criticalities). In this paper, we describe a decentralized coordination mechanism supporting adaptive replication. In order to provide a clear understanding of the specifics of our proposal, we provide a theoretical validation and report on experimental validations by confronting our proposal with an existing solution that is structurally similar.

It is assumed that only relative state or output measurements of the neighbors are available for each agent and only a part of the followers have access to the relative state or output information of the dynamic leader. When relative state measurements are available, a bounded distributed finite-time coordinated tracking controller is proposed for each follower based on nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) method. When only relative output measurements are available, robust exact differentiators are employed first to estimate the relative state information. Then a distributed finite-time coordinated tracking controller is designed based on the estimated relative state. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.

The interactions and relations between users and things need of an effective and efficient recommendation approaches to better meet users interests. Suggesting useful things in IoT environment is a very important task for many applications such as urban computing, smart cities, health care, etc., and it needs to be widely investigated. The goal of recommendation systems is to produce a set of significant suggestions for a user with given characteristics. In this paper, a multi-agent algorithm that, by exploiting of a decentralized and self organizing strategy, builds a distributed recommendation system in IoT environment, is proposed. Things are represented through bit vectors, the thing descriptors, obtained through a locality preserving hash function that maps similar things into similar bit vectors. Cyber agents manage the thing descriptors and exchange them on the basis of ad-hoc probability functions. The outcome is the emergence of an organized overlay-network of cyber agents that allows to obtain an efficient things recommender system. Preliminaries results confirm the validity of the approach.
55|7419907|Journal Article|2017|Charalampos P. Bechlioulis|Decentralized Robust Synchronization of Unknown High Order Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems With Prescribed Transient and Steady State Performance|In this paper, we consider the synchronization control problem for uncertain high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems in a leader-follower scheme, under a directed communication protocol. A robust decentralized control law of minimal complexity is proposed that achieves prescribed, arbitrarily fast and accurate synchronization of the following agents with the leader. The control protocol is decentralized in the sense that the control signal of each agent is calculated based solely on local relative state information from its neighborhood set. Additionally, no information regarding the agents'; dynamic model is employed in the design procedure. Moreover, provided that the communication graph is connected and contrary to the related works on multi-agent systems, the controller-imposed transient and steady state performance bounds are fully decoupled from: 1) the underlying graph topology, 2) the control gains selection, and 3) the agents'; model uncertainties, and are solely prescribed by certain designer-specified performance functions. Extensive simulation results clarify and verify the approach.

The paper presents the design of a general GDSS based on multi-agent approaches. In this design, we have abstracted a suite of procedures which can allow communication between the general GDSS system';s coordinator (server) and its decision-maker (customer).

55|4740844|Conference Paper|2008|Yun Xiong|An Agent-Based Approach to Mine Transcriptional Regulatory Elements|The study of transcriptional regulation mechanisms is one of current research issues in post-genomic era. However, the number of the known regulatory elements is rarely limited, and the accuracy of the state-of-the-art identification methods is still far from satisfactory. Therefore effective information, personalized service are critical features to be provided in a system, but the existing systems ignore overall performance issues. Agent technology has been used in bioinformatics. But little consideration has been taken into regulatory elements mining. In this paper, the first multi-agent-based system TReMAgent for mining regulatory elements is presented, in which novel algorithms are developed to acquire superior accuracy and integrate with existing tools utilizing agent technology to realize the collaboration and flexibility. In TReMAgent, the workflow plans will be provided automatically to meet with personalized service and databases are integrated to satisfy dynamic mining. The experimental results tested on real data sets show that TReMAgent can collect more quantities and superior accuracy elements and exhibit effective, personalized and flexible services.
55|8321620|Conference Paper|2017|Xinghong Zhang|Decentralized adaptive synchronization of a class of discrete-time nonlinear multi-agent systems with unknown parameters and high-frequency gains|This paper addresses the challenging problem of decentralized adaptive control for a class of coupled hidden leader-follower multi-agent systems, in which each agent is described by a nonlinearly parameterized uncertain model in discrete time and can interact with its neighbors via its available information on its neighbors. One of the agents is a leader, who knows the desired reference trajectory, while other agents have no access to the desired reference signal or are unaware of existence of the leader. In order to tackle unknown internal parameters and unknown high-frequency gains, a projection-type parameter estimation algorithm is proposed. Based on the certainty equivalence principle and neighborhood history information, the decentralized adaptive control is designed, under which, the boundedness of identification error is guaranteed with the help of the Lyapunov theory. Under some conditions, the multi-agent system eventually achieves strong synchronization in the presence of strong couplings. Finally, a simulation example is given to support the results of the proposed scheme.
55|6573012|Conference Paper|2013|Wenjie Lin|Detecting job interference in large distributed multi-agent systems ‚Äî A formal approach|This work is on formal modeling, analysis and detection of job interference in large distributed multi-agent systems. Such an analysis usually requires an examination of all the global system states-often impossible due to the well-known state space explosion. We obtain a sufficient condition so that job interference can be detected by observations of individual system component without the knowledge of global system states. Given that the job interference can be detected locally, we propose a guided random walk algorithm for detecting interference. We apply it to Kansei, a large and distributed wireless sensor network system with multi-agents. Ten job interference traces are identified; they have not been detected before by manual analysis and system operations. We further diagnose the detected interference for a correction of system design.
55|6390341|Conference Paper|2012|Xiong Wei|Multi-agent system for flexible job-shop scheduling problem based on human immune system|The flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is very important in both fields of production management and combinatorial optimization. The high combinatorial complexity of the problem makes it hard to find the optimal solution within reasonable time in most cases. The multi-agent optimization method can reduce the combinatorial complexity of the problem by the task decomposition and the real-time distribution. However, it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution of FJSP with multi-agent optimization method. The multi-agent scheduling system (MASS) and the human immune system (HIS) are similar in structure and negotiation strategies. In this paper, a new MASS is proposed for solving FJSP. The MASS is inspired by the structure and negotiation strategies of the HIS. The negotiation strategies of the MASS are more consistent with the negotiation strategies of the HIS. Finally, the negotiation strategies of the MASS are tested with two instances taken from the open literature and compared with the test results, which show that the proposed method is effective for solving FJSP.
55|4227543|Conference Paper|2007|Terrence P. Fries|Multi-Agent Fault Diagnosis in Manufacturing Systems Using Soft Computing|The expeditious and accurate diagnosis of faults in manufacturing systems is essential in order to avoid expensive downtime. Many artificial intelligence approaches to automated fault diagnosis use techniques that are too computationally complex to achieve a diagnosis in real-time or are too inflexible for dynamic systems. Other approaches use either structural or symptom-based reasoning. Functional approaches are unable to provide real-time response due to their computational complexity, whereas, symptom-based approaches are only able to handle situations specifically coded in rules. Current hybrid approaches that combine the two methods are too structured in their approach to switching between the reasoning methods and, therefore fail to provide the flexible, rapid response of humans experts. This paper presents a robust, extensible approach to fault diagnosis that allows unstructured switching between reasoning methods using multiple fuzzy intelligent agents that examine the problem domain from a variety of perspectives.

In this model, decreasing the total delay time and increasing the absorption to passengers of the successive trains are taken as the object. After the analysis of the character of multi-agent, the integrated control framework based on multi-agent is proposed, in which the artificial intelligence and network technology are syncretized into multi-agent. The system is divided into manager agent, region agent and train agent, it can respond and cooperated control dynamically according to the environment, so it can adjust the unexpected event automatically during the train operation and improve the operation ability of the line. The simulation result shows the train operation adjustment control based on multi-agent is reliable and effective.
55|4561872|Conference Paper|2008|Han Yu|Transforming Learning through Agent Augmented Virtual World|Recent years have seen new forms of immersive learning such as interactive storytelling in virtual learning environment. Intelligent software agents are able to provide a more attractive narrative and get the users more involved in the unfolding of the story line in the virtual world. However, designing and implementing a software agent or a multi-agent system (MAS) for this purpose requires the developer to be highly skilled in agent oriented software engineering (AOSE) and a large investment in time and effort. This raises the hurdle to develop non-trivial agent augmented interactive e-learning applications. Our research proposes a framework - the multi-agent development environment (MADE) - to resolve this problem by abstracting the agent implementation part into a reusable runtime environment so as to enable less technically inclined people (e.g. teachers) and developers with limited knowledge in AOSE to rapidly prototype a multi-agent system to be incorporated into interactive learning applications.
55|4281463|Conference Paper|2007|Nazaraf Shah|Ontological Model for Exception Management in Open Multi-Agent Systems|One of the major issues in dealing with exceptions in open multi-agent systems (MAS) is lack of uniform representation of exceptions and their shared semantics. In the absence of a uniform framework different business organization may use different representations for the same exception or may interpret the same exception in different way. In order to address this issue we present an ontological approach to provide a uniform way of representing and interpreting exceptions in cross-organizational settings. This helps agents from different organizations to interpret exceptional situations in an unambiguous way and exchange exception related information using standard structures. We believe that exception ontology along with domain ontology increases the open MAS reliability and also enhances its fault tolerance capability.

In the latter case, it is guaranteed that the average dynamics equals to the dynamics of one agent. The results are illustrated by an example.
55|8834525|Conference Paper|2019|Mochammad Sahal|Switching Formation and Topology in Cooperative Multi-Agent Source Seeking Using Gradient Estimation|Agent-based source seeking problem with switching formation and topology is addressed in this paper. This problem is relevant in, e.g., in hazardous gas leak in a chemical disaster, forest fires, nuclear disaster, etc. In the cooperative seek, agents develop a formation to effectively seek the source by communicating one to another via a communication topology. The source, or the seek target, is represented by a scalar field which describe, e.g., a temperature level, hazardous concentration of substances or vapor. Every agent has the information on its own position and the value of scalar field at any instance. The agents are identical modeled as single integrator. Consensus filter is used to synchronize the gradient value of each agent. Formation control is used to shape formation. In this paper three scenarios of switching formation are compared. These scenarios consist of 2, 3, and 4 formations respectively. The comparison is performed by computer simulation. In all scenarios, the formation of the agents can reach the sought source. The simulations show that the scenario with 2 formations is better than the scenario with 3 and 4 formations with respect to gradient connectivity of the cooperative multi-agent.

Our research has shown that a gaze aligned multi-perspective multi-screen e-Learning system provides much better immersive experience. To provide multiple perspectives of the participants, we are using 5 cameras at each participant location, each one separated by 45 degrees, covering a range of 180 degrees, so that the system can choose appropriate perspective to present to the remote participants based on set of rules. We realized that a single standard computer is not able to capture and stream more than 2 HD video streams reliably, so we had to design a flexible multi-agent system to distribute the video streaming across 3 computers at each classroom. In this paper we present the architecture of our Smart classroom system, CMAC.

A consensus protocol based on sampled-data control and edge event-driven techniques is proposed, and two associated event-triggering rules are presented. These edge events rely on the information of the corresponding two neighboring agents, and the event-triggering actions over edges are independent of each other. It is proved that the proposed protocol can solve the state consensus problem when the topology is connected, and also can reduce the controller-updating costs and communication costs. Finally, simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

56|8482957|Conference Paper|2018|Hao Fu|Optimal Consensus Control of Unknown Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming via MRAC|This paper introduces an optimal consensus control scheme for nonlinear multi-agent systems with completely unknown dynamics. In general, it is difficult to solve the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, which the optimal consensus control relies on in multi-agent systems, especially unknown nonlinear systems. For the purpose of solving the problem, we propose an optimal consensus control approach based on the model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Using the structure of the diagonal recurrent neural network, the identifier and controller are devised to achieve MRAC for every plant of the unknown nonlinear systems, i.e. the reference model serves as a dynamic model of each individual agent. Then, according to reference models of distributed agents, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is introduced to approximate the solution of the coupled HJB equations.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level, multi-agent architecture that accomplishes data fusion through layers encompassing initial data input and classification, secondary classification and grouping, and finally human-agent interaction. Small, limited-scope agents cooperate to complete the analysis/fusion process. This cooperation is mediated by corresponding opinions in the mode of belief calculus and subjective logic utilizing our evidential reasoning network (ERN). Thus, the user gains the ability to control and filter fusion activities based on the quality and pedigree of the underlying data.

56|8901077|Conference Paper|2019|Gaurav Dixit|Dirichlet-Multinomial Counterfactual Rewards for Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems|Multi-robot teams have been shown to be effective in accomplishing complex tasks which require tight coordination among team members. In homogeneous systems, recent work has demonstrated that ‚Äústepping stone‚Äù rewards are an effective way to provide agents with feedback on potentially valuable actions even when the agent-to-agent coupling requirements of an objective are not satisfied. In this work, we propose a new mechanism for inferring hypothetical partners in tightly-coupled, heterogeneous systems called Dirichlet-Multinomial Counterfactual Selection (DMCS). Using DMCS, we show that agents can learn to infer appropriate counterfactual partners to receive more informative stepping stone rewards by testing in a modified multi-rover exploration problem. We also show that DMCS outperforms a random partner selection baseline by over 40%, and we demonstrate how domain knowledge can be used to induce a prior to guide the agent learning process. Finally, we show that DMCS maintains superior performance for up to 15 distinct rover types compared to the performance of the baseline which degrades rapidly.
56|5478452|Conference Paper|2010|Rajiv T. Maheswaran|Multi-agent systems for the real world|Our work addresses the effectiveness of collaborative divisions of labor between agents and humans in real-time dynamic and uncertain domains such as disaster rescue, hospital triage, and military operations. Our particular focus is systems where each person is assisted by an agent running on a device that they carry in the field. Such combinations make it possible to explore synergies between the unique strengths of both humans and machines, rather than struggling to build systems focused on ameliorating the weaknesses of one or the other. Specifically, we rely upon people for a sense of critical factors that constrain likely solutions, and for systems to do efficient, comprehensive and accurate computations (once problem complexity has been contained). In that spirit, we introduce a new approach, STaC, based on the premise that people have good intuitions about how to solve problems in each domain. The idea is to enable users to encode their intuitions as guidance for a system of agents, and for the agents to use this guidance when assisting the users in addressing the problems. The key to STaC is using the human users'; guidance to break complex activities into simpler task structures that can be turned over to a single agent to determine who does what, when and where with respect to these significantly simpler task structures. This mitigates the distributed reasoning challenge and enables using auxiliary solvers based on established AI techniques capable of producing good solutions when given problems at this smaller scale. These smaller task structures can be solved independently because the agent system can assume that the human guidance has addressed any significant dependencies. STaC addresses tracking the dynamism in these task structures, the transitioning of agent assignments between these smaller task structures and the invocation of auxiliary solvers. Given that the task structures are treated independently and sufficiently small to be centralized, we call them sandbox reasoners. The sandbox reasoners required in each domain are different, so custom code must be written for each domain. However, the benefit of the approach is that sandbox reasoners are significantly simpler than the custom solvers required to produce a custom solution for a domain. We worked for 18 months to build an agent system where a team of humans with radios and our coordinator agents competed against human teams collaborating only via radios in field exercises involving simulated disaster-rescue operations. The results provided significant evidence for the benefits of our approach. Our starting point was our generic CSC system developed during the previous two years to solve generic, synthetically generated problem instances. Even though the synthetically-generated problem instances were created from templates that combined ‚Äútypical‚Äù coordination situations, the resulting problems and task structures were not understandable by humans. In contrast, the field exercise problems appeal to a lifetime of experience coordinating every day activities. Intuitions about space, distance, time, importance and risk, that are quite natural to humans, enabled the human teams to rapidly devise sophisticated strategies. It became rapidly obvious that the generic CSC system would not be able to produce solutions comparable to the desired sophisticated, coordinated behavior of human-produced strategies. To gain the best of both worlds, we extended our approach so that policies would be constrained by guidance provided by users. The first set of field exercises used a simple language for guidance that specified a sequence of sites to visit where all agents were a single coordinating group. The system made decisions that it could evaluate accurately (e.g., how to perform repairs or rescue injured at a single site). In the first set of exercises, we were competitive, but not markedly superior, losing in two out of three tested scenarios and winning in the third. The final language for guidance was inspired by observations of the radio-team strategies, extensive discussions with subject matter experts and extensive numbers of simulations. While the human team could not execute a strategy as well as we could, the space of strategies that they were able to engage were far more sophisticated than ours. Thus, we created a more sophisticated formalism for capturing human strategic guidance that resulted in STaC. We enabled the ability to create multiple independent coordination groups with overlapping membership. The system relied on metrics to determine how to move agents among groups. We also introduced the ability to constrain the activities of each coordinating group. With those changes, we outperformed the radio team in all second-round tests because they were able to communicate their strategy to their agents, and the system optimized the execution of the strategy, adapting it to the dynamics of the environment.

56|9327610|Conference Paper|2020|Junhao Ren|Tolerance and detection for the edge disconnection in consensus problems of multi-agent systems with the time-delay|In this paper, tolerance and detection problems for the edge disconnection in consensus issues of discrete-time multi-agent systems with the time-delay are investigated. We first discuss the tolerance of the edge disconnection in consensus problems. For the case with the strongly connected communication topology, the faulty system can still achieve consensus if the connectedness of the multi-agent system is not changed as the edge disconnection, but the consensus value of the faulty system might be different from the original one. Especially, the consensus value of the system with the edge disconnection will be consistent with the original one if the communication topology of the faulty system is undirected and connected. In addition, the detection problem of the edge disconnection in multi-agent systems is considered by transforming the detection problem into the discernibility problem between the faulty system and the original system. By the state augmentation method and observability properties of the system, some equivalent conditions for the discernibility of the edge disconnection are established.

It is shown that when the null space of the Gauge transformed graph Laplacian is spanned by the Kronecker product of an all-one vector and a set of orthogonal vectors, the algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalue zero cannot exceed the nullity of the graph Laplacian, thus admitting a proper blocking of the system matrix';s Jordan normal form. Second-order bipartite consensus is thereby achieved independent of the structural balance of the network. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.

It is supposed that there are two layers, i.e., the leaders'; layer and followers'; layer, in the considered multi-agent systems. Unlike most existing results on distributed consensus of multi-agent systems, the control objective in this paper is to make the states of each follower located on followers'; layer track those of its corresponding leader located on leaders'; layer. Furthermore, the network topologies of the leaders and the followers may be heterogeneous. Based on the assumption that the states of leaders are uniformly bounded, some sufficient criteria for node-to-node practical consensus are obtained by using differential equation theory.
56|7844859|Conference Paper|2016|Sylvain Sagot|A multi-agent approach for building a fuzzy decision support system to assist the SEO process|The process of changing a website position, which affects its visibility in the Internet search engine results, is called Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The modeling of SEO process has been considered a complex problem especially because of the dynamic change of the volume of the information, the increase of the diversity of heterogeneous information and their interactions, the lack of transparency of ranking models and the uncertainty of change in terms of results. Thus, SEO process represents a heterogeneous, distributed, complex, dynamic, adaptive, and evolving system. Therefore, from process and organizational points of view, SEO can be modeled by using multi-agent systems. Further to this proposition, we identified several groups of autonomous agents, representing criteria for the implementation of the SEO process. In this study, we tested several SEO criteria in real conditions on the Google search engine. Results from these experiments permitted us to determine the fuzzy decision rules integrated in a SEO decision support system. These fuzzy decision rules can assist SEO practitioners in their work to take good decisions according to the client';s needs and the search engine criteria impact evolution.
56|6495175|Conference Paper|2012|Yassine Gangat|Another Step toward Reusability in Agent-Based Simulation: Multi-behaviors &amp; aMVC|The multi-agent systems are successfully used in modeling of dynamic complex systems, and simulations of these models reinforce the knowledge of experts and even allow them to explore new horizons or to cross boundaries. This is the reason why the models being tackled are increasingly varied, and as one goes along with experimentations, these models are completed, intercrossed. Consequently they become increasingly complex. In our previous work, we proposed a first modeling approach to support this complexity increase: the Dynamic-Oriented Modeling (DOM). The application of this approach can effectively support the increase of the model. This increase applies to both agents and environments. This DOM approach tackles the problem of the latter by splitting in multiple parts. But if DOM led to organize properly the multiple environments that come into play, little support is provided to organize and manage the increasing complexity of the agents themselves. Inevitably, when we reach a quite advanced stage of evolution of the model, the agents eventually reach a critical mass (either in formalization or code) that makes them more and more hard to comprehend. In this paper, we illustrate this phenomenon and show that it quickly takes the upper hand against the benefits of DOM, as it can eventually block the potential development, or even reuse, of the model. Then we explain that a solution to this &#034;side effect&#034; could structure the architecture of agents, a structure capable of maintaining readability and flexibility of the formalization of the agent throughout the growth process of the global model. We study a well known pattern in software engineering: the MVC pattern, which can be reused here to meet this objective. We will present in details how this pattern could be instantiated in the field of MAS architecture, and how, ultimately, it can be an effective new way to formalize agents in a method called Multi-Behaviors Modelization.
56|9427147|Journal Article|2021|Md. Kamruzzaman|A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Enhance Power System Resilience Using Shunt Resources|Existing power system resilience enhancement methods, such as proactive generation rescheduling, movable sources dispatch, and network topology reconfiguration, do not explore the capability and flexibility of shunts to maintain voltage stability during and after disrupting events. Besides, existing methods rely on accurate system models that are not easily scalable for large integrated power grids. In this paper, a data-driven multi-agent framework based on a deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm is proposed to overcome the computation and scalability concerns related to precise system models and to plan for the deployment of shunts for power system resilience enhancement. Specifically, voltage violations due to outages of multiple lines during windstorms are taken as an example of a power system resilience improvement problem. Then, a multi-agent based hybrid soft actor critic (HSAC) algorithm is developed for offline siting and sizing as well as online controlling of shunt reactive power compensators to enhance voltage resilience. The HSAC algorithm is derived from the fundamental SAC algorithms that contain both continuous and discrete action spaces. The proposed multi-agent framework learns from previous experiences and eventually gets trained to determine proper locations and sizes for shunts to avoid voltage violations during multiple line failures. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems. The results show that the proposed multi-agent framework is effective for installation planning and controlling of shunts to enhance power system resilience.
56|4052951|Conference Paper|2006|Frodi Hammer|A Multi-Agent Approach to Social Human Behaviour in Children's Play|This paper introduces a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for modelling social behaviours in children';s play. The children, the dynamics of their play, and the playground are modelled into a MAS following the VOWELS paradigm; thus, modelling the children as the agents, the playground as the environment, and the dynamics of their play as the interactions and organization. Utilizing the Play- ware playground as the environment, an interface to the environment can be defined, which allows us to formally model the children and the dynamics of their play (i.e. their individual and social behaviour) as populations and organizations in accordance with the PopOrg paradigm. The MAS model has been used to design an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture capable of classifying social behaviours within appropriate categories. Experiments with children have been performed, and data recorded from the Playware playground during the experiments has been used to train the ANN. The ANN has been validated according to an external observer to correctly classify 70% of the social behaviours observed during the experiments.

Pipattanasomporn|Multi-agent systems in a distributed smart grid: Design and implementation|The objective of this paper is to discuss the design and implementation of a multi-agent system that provides intelligence to a distributed smart grid - a smart grid located at a distribution level. A multi-agent application development will be discussed that involves agent specification, application analysis, application design and application realization. The message exchange in the proposed multi-agent system is designed to be compatible with an IP-based network (IP = Internet Protocol) which is based on the IEEE standard on Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agent (FIPA). The paper demonstrates the use of multi-agent systems to control a distributed smart grid in a simulated environment. The simulation results indicate that the proposed multi-agent system can facilitate the seamless transition from grid connected to an island mode when upstream outages are detected. This denotes the capability of a multi-agent system as a technology for managing the microgrid operation.
57|4376602|Conference Paper|2007|Lianfang Kong|A Multi-Layered Control Architecture of Intelligent Agent|Usually control architecture of an intelligent Agent is structured as a single level, all related control issues are determined in this level. Since the Agent may work in a complex organizational context and it may have multiple complicated interdependent tasks to process. Obviously, it is difficult to construct an integrated control framework in which all the control issues are determined in an efficient way. In this paper, a three-layered control architecture for an intelligent Agent is presented. The control Agent architecture consists of three layers: global control layer, detailed control layer and execution layer, the first two control layers are decision making layers. Each control layer in this control architecture has different function in control process: global control layer deals with the formation of high level goals and objectives for the Agent. Detailed control layer deals with feasibility and implementation of operations. The execution layer executes those actions determined by the upper control layers. Furthermore we use TAEMS (task analysis environment modeling and simulation) to represent structures of those tasks that agent has to execute. The primary advantage of this three-layered control Agent architecture is that all the control issues can be addressed concurrently and done in an efficient way.

The control objective is to make the outputs of agents reach a desired formation while tracking a leader. The formation control problem of heterogeneous discrete-time multi-agent systems is first converted into a robust output regulation problem, and then, a distributed formation control scheme based on output regulation framework is proposed.

Compared with the existing studies over structurally balanced networks where hostile relations can only exist between two agent subgroups, the main highlight of this brief is to extend the bipartite tracking behavior to a more general cooperative-hostile network, in which hostile relations can exist within and between agent subgroups at the same time. Based on products of super-stochastic matrices, a sufficient criterion related to the network structure, such as network connectivity and positive and negative edge weights, is established. Meanwhile, it is also shown theoretically that each subsystem can be allowed to be strictly unstable, and the upper bound of unstable eigenvalue modules of the system matrix is given. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical result.

In contrast to the existing results, we propose a fully-distributed consensus algorithm, which just need the output of it neighbors in the feedback controller, except its own state information. Specifically, it is shown that, with a suitably designed similarity transformation, consensus is reached under only the necessary and sufficient condition of an interconnection graph having a spanning tree. The proposed approach relaxes some restrictive assumptions commonly considered in the available literature, such as imposing global gains in the network and/or exploiting additional information from neighboring agents other than their position-like states or output. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 control theory is used to attenuate the adaptive fuzzy approximation error to a prescribed level. Therefore the agents motion is forced to obey the dynamics defined by the simple inter-agent artificial potential functions. Stability proof is given using Lyapunov functions, which shows the robust behavior of controller with respect to disturbances and system uncertainties. Finally, simulation results are demonstrated for a multi-agent formation problem of a group of six agents, illustrating the effective attenuation of fuzzy logic approximation error.

As a result, a multi-agent system containing such an actuator saturating agent can only reach regional consensus, that is, consensus can be achieved only when the initial state of each agent resides in a region of the state space. The region of all these initial states is referred to as the domain of consensus. In general, the domain of consensus cannot be exactly characterized. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the domain of consensus of a multi-agent system with an agent subject to actuator saturation. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which an ellipsoidal set can be used as an estimate of the domain of consensus are established. Based on these conditions, an LMI-based optimization problem is formulated for obtaining the largest ellipsoidal estimate of the domain of consensus. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show the relationship between the size of the largest ellipsoidal estimate and the communication topology of the multi-agent system.

Hemalatha|Central Anti-Money Laundering control system using agents technology|The criminal individuals and organizations in today';s world including terrorists have taken advantage of the available financial systems, to launder money from illegal proceeds and for their illegal activities. India is particularly under threat from terrorists and it also has been difficult to track down the finance of criminal elements. There have been some proposals in the past for anti money laundering [AML] solutions. However none of them were able to be very effective in India, as our country';s vastness, and lack of AML compliance by banks was not taken to consideration. In our approach, after considering the fact that the government in India plays a significant role in regulating the economy and financial practices, we propose a system in which there is central monitoring system, controlled by an independent central agency, which in turn is connected to many regional centres throughout the country, using agents technology. Each of these regional centres will be connected to banks within their given areas. The regional centres will monitor the transactions of all the different banks in a given area and report the suspicious customers back to the central monitoring system. Then central monitoring system reports to the officials concerned and it is investigated into. This is novel agent based approach for a national framework, which is India specific, will ensure the enforcement of AML laws in our country, as every bank will be required to register themselves with a regional monitoring system.

57|672965|Conference Paper|1997|Lin Zeng|Multiple intelligent agent supported Internet security system: issues, current solutions, and a proposed approach|The Internet has become a common target to attack because of security concerns. Reports of incidents, such as attempted and successful intrusions, have grown dramatically. Several studies have shown that many individuals and companies are abstaining from joining the Internet simply because of such security concerns. The article presents an innovative approach to Internet security which is based on a multiple intelligent agent architecture. This multi agent based security system is focused on one network domain (subnet) only. Four kinds of agents are deployed in the system. They are User Agent, Domain Security Agent (DS Agent), Access Control Agent (AC Agent), and Audit Agent. A Security Information Repository is used to store security information for the network domain, including access information, user profiles, application profiles, authentication keys, etc. These agents communicate with each other through the Information Broker which runs as a co-ordinator not only for the security agents but also for all of the accessible applications in the subnet. A firewall is used as the interface between the subnet and the Internet. Its main function is to filter out the requests which intend to bypass the Information Broker. Additionally, in order to handle the requests from users in other subnets, agents may contact their peer agents in the remote network through the Internet.

This bipartite time-varying formation is composed of two sub-formations whose relationship is opposite. By parameterization the unknown nonlinear items of all agents, a distributed adaptive proportional-integral protocol is presented under undirected signed topology to ensure the convergence of the bipartite time-varying formation error. Some sufficient conditions for choosing suitable control parameters are given. In the case of systems with external time-varying but bounded disturbances, the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the formation error and its integration can be guaranteed by the proposed control protocol. A simulative example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.
57|1194567|Conference Paper|2003|J. Colloc|A multi-agent approach to involve multiple knowledge models and the case base reasoning approach in decision support systems|The building of Decision Support System (DSS) in complex domains like management, medicine, environment...requires to involve various data and knowledge models and to support the reasoning modes taking place in the professional cognitive process during his or her job practice. We propose a Multi-Agent Decision Support System (MADSS) architecture to integrate the different categories of knowledge representation. We describe the functionalities and capacities of cognitive agents implementing these different kinds of knowledge and bringing them to cooperate in elaborating the decision. Agents are able to commit to build sub-decisions and thus, the system provides a whole sequence of decisions fitting the user';s usual cognitive scheme. We trust in a supervised architecture because such a MADSS must be goal driven by the user';s requirements. However, the agents remain autonomous and keep the opportunity to commit or not to the task exhibited by the supervisor at the moment.
57|7554583|Conference Paper|2016|Xiwang Dong|Time-varying group formation control for general linear multi-agent systems with directed topologies|Time-varying group formation control problems for general linear multi-agent systems with directed topologies are studied, where the agents in the multi-agent system are classified into subgroups and each subgroup is required to form a specified time-varying sub-formation. Different from the traditional complete formation, where only one formation is realized by the multi-agent system, in the group formation, there could be multiple sub-formations. Firstly, a time-varying group formation protocol is constructed by local relative information of each agent and its neighbors. Then nonsingular transformations are applied to the closed-loop multi-agent systems. Sufficient conditions for the multi-agent systems to achieve time-varying group formation are further presented together with the time-varying group formation feasibility constraints. Explicit expressions of the subgroup formation reference functions are derived to describe the macroscopic movement of the time-varying subgroup formations. It is shown that the subgroup formation reference functions are jointly determined by the dynamics, the initial states and formation information of each agent in the same subgroup, and also by the interaction topologies among agents from the same or different subgroups. Moreover, an approach to design the time-varying group formation protocol is proposed by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Finally, a numerical example with three subgroups is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

Academic and industrial actors are engaged to develop the IoT service composition paradigm. Indeed, it enables the aggregation of IoT services to satisfy complex supplies from several application domains. It can also be used to develop original IoT applications in an efficient, flexible and dynamic way. This paper proposes an approach for IoT service composition using a multi-agent system where several agents are engaged to satisfy the user';s request. Simple reflex agents represent services, links, and requests. However, goal-based agent stands for the reasoner of the proposed MAS. The SysML language and the Netlogo platform are used respectively to design and implement the proposed approach. The test scenarios show obviously the importance, practicability, and suitability of the multi-agent systems for the IoT application based on service composition.

The triggering function based on the states of the agents is designed. The impulsive instants are determined by the triggering function and triggering condition, that is, the impulsive effect performs at the instants when the events occur, and so as the controllers update. It is shown that not only the consensus can be achieved without the continue communication between neighboring agents but also the global information/parameters of the concerned closed-loop system are avoided. Moreover, the Zeno-behavior is excluded for the concerned closed-loop system. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

58|8951127|Journal Article|2021|Ying Wan|Distributed Consensus Tracking of Networked Agent Systems Under Denial-of-Service Attacks|Distributed consensus tracking problem of networked agent systems with directed topologies under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is investigated. The considered networked agent network consists of a physical layer with fixed physical links and a cyber layer with cyber control units. Both the communication network connecting these two layers and the cyber communication network within the cyber layer may subject to malicious DoS attacks. These two types of attacks have different impacts on the networked system; the former one affects the timely update of control inputs, and the latter influences the connection weights of the cyber communication graph. First, for DoS signals occurring in the communication network which transmits the state and control input information between the two layers, the distributed control protocol based on the event-triggered scheme and locally deployed estimators are designed. Efficient algorithms for selecting event-triggered control parameters and Zeno-free triggered parameters are given to ensure the mean-square consensus. The relationships between the system';s parameters and the features of DoS attacks are successfully revealed. Second, corresponding theoretical analysis is derived for consensus tracking of the networked systems when DoS attacks are launched within the cyber layer. Conditions concerning the length of repairing time and indexes of DoS attacks are given by utilizing hybrid control theory. At last, the effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated by performing simulations on multirobot systems.

58|7446564|Conference Paper|2015|Shan Li|A hierarchical multi-agent evaluation scheme for integrating distributed energy resources in distribution systems|Modern distribution grid is a combination of distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems, and controllable loads connected to mid-voltage or low-voltage network that can operate in deregulated manners. High penetration of renewable resources at distribution level places new challenges on the planning and economic operation of the distribution systems. This paper proposes a hierarchical control framework based on multi-agent method to allow more flexible control on the distributed energy resources and adjustable loads at the user end while minimizing the computation burden on the distribution grid operator. The impact of large-scale DG integration is evaluated in terms of important factors such as voltage stability and line loading rate. A multi-agent network is structured based on the critical line identification technology for the purpose of reducing the control complexity in the reliable system operation. The developed mechanism coordinates the operation among different generation units and loads. The adjustable DG and loads at the customer side and controllable reactive power devices are deployed to limit the voltage deviation within the acceptable range. Simulation results clearly indicate that the agent-based hierarchical control scheme is effective in distributed energy resources management among multiple clusters of DG and variable load.

58|9567893|Conference Paper|2021|Mohammed Ahmed Jubair|Exploring the Role of Multi-Agent Systems in Improving K-Means Clustering Method|Clustering algorithms are attracting much application interest due to the significant growth in the rate of data generation. However, the high computational complexity of the existing clustering algorithms has rendered them ineffective in several ways. Therefore, this study proposes a novel parallel clustering algorithm that integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with the K-means algorithm; hence, the proposed novel algorithm is termed Multi-agent-K-means (MK-means). The MK-means is based on the concept of separating the activating agents to perform clustering while considering a different subset of features for each agent. This is aimed at the preservation of the dataset while improving the clustering accuracy. The cluster centers are calculated for each partition before being merged and clustered again. The statistical significance of the proposed approach is provided. The effectiveness of the proposed MK-means clustering algorithm was evaluated using Wine datasets, and the performance is compared with that of the traditional K-means algorithm. The results analysis proved the superiority of the proposed MK-mean clustering algorithm over the traditional version of the K-means algorithm. This suggests the suitability of the proposed algorithm as a clustering technique that can also be applied to other clustering algorithms that are based on the concept of initial cluster centroids selection.

First, an asynchronous sampled-data hybrid consensus control protocol is proposed, which has an extra reset control part in contrast with traditional linear control protocol, and is beneficial for achieving better transient consensus performance. Then, with several properly defined internal variables, a hybrid model consisting of both flow and jump dynamics is constructed to describe the closed-loop dynamics. Based on this model and internal decreasing functions, Lyapunov-based stability conditions are derived, and larger upper bound of sampling period can be obtained compared to the existing related work. Finally, an example is given to show the superiority of the proposed approach.

Due to the diversity and heterogeneity in terms of the types of client devices and network connections that people use to access the systems as well the special needs and preferences that end users might have, system adaptability, interoperability, reusability and reliability, etc., are very complex and difficult to solve. Agent and agent-based computing provide the natural and valid means for building complex distributed applications and are becoming a powerful paradigm for designing and developing complex software systems. We address some of fundamental challenges in supporting large-scale distributed system: adaptability, interoperability, reusability and reliability, and a multi-agent framework is proposed for constructing those systems.

While the ant metaphor has been successfully applied to network routing both in wireless and fixed networks, little is yet known about its applicability to the task of query routing in distributed environments. We point out the similarities and dissimilarities between routing of data packets and routing of queries, and we present the design of SemAnt, which is based on the ant colony optimization meta-heuristic. For experimental evaluation, we deploy the algorithm in a peer-to-peer environment with a real-world application scenario and compare its performance against the well-known k-random walker approach. As we show, the benefits of SemAnt are that the routes for queries are optimized according to their popularity, and that the algorithm is highly suitable for volatile environments

So by employing the prediction results, agents can modify their own negotiation strategies in order to achieve an agreement much quicker or to look after much higher benefits. Even though some of prediction strategies have been proposed by researchers, most of them are based on machine learning mechanisms which require a training process in advance. However, in most circumstances, the machine learning approaches might not work well for some kinds of agents whose behaviors are excluded in the training data. In order to address this issue, we propose three regression functions to predict agents'; behaviors in this paper, which are linear, power and quadratic regression functions. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed functions can estimate partners'; potential behaviors successfully and efficiently in different circumstances.

The designed output feedback controller depends on the measurement outputs of a agent itself and its adjacent agents via a given topology, where the uniform quantizations are used to characterize the information transmissions between adjacent agents. The definition of mean- square quasi-consensus is employed to reflect the characteristics of consensus behavior in random case and the controller gain variations are model by the multiplicative noises. We focus on the design of non-fragile output feedback controller such that the consensus performance satisfies the pre-specified upper bound constraint at each sampling instant. By using the linear matrix inequality technique, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the desired performance requirements and the existence of the controller gain. In addition, the optimal consensus performance is obtained by solving an optimization problem. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed non-fragile control method.

We then present an initial concept for such an approach. In our method, we use Deep RL agents, who have learned to efficiently guide products through the plant and achieve near-optimal timing regarding resource allocation. Each product is controlled by its own agent, which can handle unforeseen machine failures, re-configurations of the plant topology and the consideration of local and global optimization goals. We created a virtual representation of the FMS using a Petri net, modelling the plant topology and the product flow. The agents'; task is to navigate the product to the corresponding machine by choosing the according transition of the Petri net. The training consists of four stages from learning rough rules in order to fulfill a job in a Single-Agent RL setup to learning thoughtful collaboration between agents in a Multi-Agent RL (MARL) setup. We proved the feasibility of the first and second training stage by applying it to the virtual depiction of a specific research plant and obtained promising results. With this concept of a self-learning control policy, online-scheduling can be applied with less effort required to customize the setup for various FMSs.

The domain of traffic and transportation systems is well suited for an agent-based approach because transportation systems are usually geographically distributed in dynamic changing environments. Our literature survey shows that the techniques and methods resulting from the field of agent and multiagent systems have been applied to many aspects of traffic and transportation systems, including modeling and simulation, dynamic routing and congestion management, and intelligent traffic control. This paper examines an agent-based approach and its applications in different modes of transportation, including roadway, railway, and air transportation. This paper also addresses some critical issues in developing agent-based traffic control and management systems, such as interoperability, flexibility, and extendibility. Finally, several future research directions toward the successful deployment of agent technology in traffic and transportation systems are discussed.

For the case where the agent dynamics is assumed to be general linear system and each agent has access to the local output information, the observer-based protocols with quantized information are adopted; both the full output quantization fashion and the partial output quantization fashion are considered, respectively. It is proved that with appropriate control feedback matrices, the consensus can be achieved under the quantization constraints. Numerical examples are also provided to verify the theoretical results.

59|4281792|Conference Paper|2006|Hayfa Zgaya|Dynamic approach to reassign tasks when servers breakdown in a Multimodal Information System|The challenge of multimodal information systems is to provide transport';s customers with pertinent real time information during their travels. Unfortunately, the exponential growth of services and information providers available on large networks increases the system decision';s difficulty to offer best solutions in term of cost and response time. The complexity of such systems can be properly described in terms of interaction between different kinds of autonomous entities. Therefore we propose a multi-agent system, using mobile agent';s technology, which is able to reduce network load and overcome its latency. Furthermore, this system is able to provide travellers pertinent interactive information in any chosen data format, taking into account their mobility. However, huge networks suffer from a high incidence of network errors. For this problematic, we propose in this paper a services reassignment process to find rapid solutions in spite of possible occurring trouble through the information providers'; network (crash, bottleneck, failure...)

Furthermore, we discuss the issue of agent mobility and argue why such agents have been proposed for the system under consideration.

59|9537696|Early Access Article|2021|Michael Meindl|Collective Iterative Learning Control: Exploiting Diversity in Multi-Agent Systems for Reference Tracking Tasks|Multi-agent systems (MASs) can autonomously learn to solve previously unknown tasks by means of each agent';s individual intelligence as well as by collaborating and exploiting collective intelligence. This article considers a group of autonomous agents learning to track the same given reference trajectory in a possibly small number of trials. We propose a novel collective learning control method that combines iterative learning control (ILC) with a collective update strategy. We derive conditions for desirable convergence properties of such systems. We show that the proposed method allows the collective to combine the advantages of the agents'; individual learning strategies and thereby overcomes trade-offs and limitations of single-agent ILC. This benefit is achieved by designing a heterogeneous collective, i.e., a different learning law is assigned to each agent. All theoretical results are confirmed in simulations and experiments with two-wheeled-inverted-pendulum robots (TWIPRs) that jointly learn to perform the desired maneuver.

To solve the problem of flexible and dynamic system integration, agent techniques is introduced. On the basis of researches on CNP, an implementation of contract net protocol based on information intermediary service (CNPIIS) is proposed to support dynamic task allocations between modules wrapped into agents. Combining with the concept of degree of credibility (DOC) and degree of availability (DOA), CNPIIS made further extensions to CNP by the idea of providing services which enabled the initiator find a contractor more accurately and effectively. The aim of CNPIIS is to relieve the communication load and improve the efficiency of negotiation. CNPIIS was applied to the agent-based system integration tool and has been demonstrated to be effective and of high efficiency with assured quality in the experiment of border and coast defense simulation system.

Stamouli|Multi-Agent Formation Control Based on Distributed Estimation With Prescribed Performance|We consider the distributed simultaneous estimation and formation control problem for swarms of identical mobile agents with limited communication, sensing and computation capabilities. In particular, we develop a novel scalable algorithm that encodes the formation specifications of the swarm via geometric moment statistics, which are estimated by a distributed scheme with prescribed performance guarantees. Based on the locally available information, each agent calculates an estimate of the global formation statistics, which is then employed by its local motion controller, thus creating a feedback interconnection between the estimator and the controller. The proposed scheme guarantees convergence of the global formation statistics to the desired values, while decoupling the estimation performance from the control performance. Moreover, a minimum allowable inter-agent distance can be predetermined so that inter-agent collision avoidance is achieved. Finally, simulation paradigms are provided to validate the approach.

Dynamic output feedback protocols are applied to solve the consensus problem. Being different from the low-order integrator and continuous-time systems, it is revealed that the solvability of the consensus depends on the weights of the topology. The consensus problem is converted to the simultaneous mean square stability of some stochastic switching subsystems. By considering the robust stability of certain system with uncertainty, a sufficient condition of the weights under which there exist dynamic output feedback protocols solving the consensus problem is given. Proper protocol parameters are further provided.
59|5616080|Conference Paper|2010|Andreas L. Symeonidis|Monitoring Agent Communication in Soft Real-Time Environments|Real-time systems can be defined as systems operating under specific timing constraints, either hard or soft ones. In principle, agent systems are considered inappropriate for such kinds of systems, due to the asynchronous nature of their communication protocols, which directly influences their temporal behavior. Nevertheless, multi-agent systems could be successfully employed for solving problems where failure to meet a deadline does not have serious consequences, given the existence of a fail-safe system mechanism. Current work focuses on the analysis of multi-agent systems behavior under such soft real-time constraints. To this end, ERMIS has been developed: an integrated framework that provides the agent developer with the ability to benchmark his/her own architecture and identify its limitations and its optimal timing behavior, under specific hardware/software constraints. A variety of MAS configurations have been tested and indicative results are discussed within the context of this paper.

The targeted system is the city with its mobility patterns. The goal of MIRO project is to study service accessibility in the city. In fact, we simulate the city with multi agent systems using them to represent each part of the system(individuals, buildings, streets,). The MIRO team is composed by scientists of several domains (computer sciences, geography or economy), so we want to construct a model of the city to share knowledges of each domain. The next step, we will use verification approach in order to validate the model and then the simulator because we want to generate simulator from model. Thus, we propose a method for modeling such complex system. This method is based on AML (Agent Modeling Language) that is a language well adapted for modeling multi-agent systems. We, then, present a spatial AML meta-model coupled with a method. The use case is the MIRO project.

60|5076830|Conference Paper|2009|Zheng Xiao|Learning Task Allocation for Multiple Flows in Multi-Agent Systems|Task allocation is a key problem for agent to reach cooperation in multi-agent systems. Lately task flows are replacing traditional static tasks, thus real-time dynamic task allocation mechanisms draw more attention. Though scheduling single task flow is well investigated, little work on allocation of multiple task flows has been done. In this paper a distributed and self-adaptable scheduling algorithm based on Q-learning for multiple task flows is proposed. This algorithm can not only adapt to task arrival process on itself, but also fully consider the influence from task flows on other agents. Besides, its distributed property guaranteed that it can be applied to open multi-agent systems with local view. Reinforcement learning makes allocation adapt to task load and node distribution. It is verified that this algorithm improves task throughput, and decreases average execution time per task.

The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations of radial 6.6-kV test system with successful results.

60|7505244|Conference Paper|2016|Xiaofeng Zong|Stochastic consensus of linear multi-agent systems with multiplicative measurement noises|In this work, stochastic consensus of linear multi-agent systems with multiplicative measurement noises is investigated under undirected graphs. Based on the algebraic graph theory and the matrix theory, the consensus problem is converted into the stochastic stability problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by multiplicative noises. Then by stochastic stability theorem for SDEs, the stochastic consensus conditions are given for the multi-agent systems. For the general linear multi-agent systems, the sufficient conditions for the mean square and the almost sure consensus are obtained based on the solution to an algebraic Riccati equation, where the consentability condition on the algebraic connectivity and the channel uncertainties is revealed. For the case of second-order integrator dynamics, by choosing some appropriate Lyapunov functions, the sufficient conditions for the mean square and the almost sure consensus, and the necessary conditions for the mean square consensus are derived. Moreover, it is shown that for any bounded noise intensities, the mean square and the almost sure consensus can be achieved by carefully choosing the control gain.

It is assumed that external disturbances affect the PMSMs, so a robust protocol based on dynamic sliding mode control has been proposed that ensures consensus of multi-agent systems and the stability is investigated by Lyapunov theory. Then an extended state observer (ESO) is proposed to estimate the upper bounds of disturbances which cause a more accurate response in sliding mode control.

60|8703839|Journal Article|2019|Miel Sharf|Network Feedback Passivation of Passivity-Short Multi-Agent Systems|In this letter, we propose a network-optimization framework for the analysis of multi-agent systems with passive-short agents. We consider the known connection between diffusively coupled maximally equilibrium-independent passive systems, and network optimization, culminating in a pair of dual convex network optimization problems, whose minimizers are exactly the steady-states of the closed-loop system. We propose a network-based regularization term to the network optimization problem and show that it results in a network-based feedback using only relative outputs. We prove that if the average of the passivity indices is positive, then we convexify the problem, passivize the agents, and that steady-states of the augmented system correspond to the minimizers of the regularized network optimization problem. We also suggest a hybrid approach, in which only a subset of agents sense their own output, and show that if the set is nonempty, then we can always achieve the same correspondence as above, regardless of the passivity indices. We demonstrate our results on a traffic model with non-passive agents and limited GNSS reception.

A novel co-design optimization is proposed to simultaneously design all required control and DET parameters. We use the flexibility of the proposed co-design method to optimize the inter-event interval for a predefined formation convergence rate. The optimization is based on the scalarization (weighted sum) approach which provides a structured trade-off between the formation convergence rate and intensity of the event-triggerings. Simulations for multi-agent systems consisting a class of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) quantify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

61|6968589|Conference Paper|2014|Aabha Barve|Autonomous formation control and target tracking in distributed Multi-agent System|A Multi-agent System can be considered as distributed system consisting of multiple interacting intelligent agents acting on a common environment. Agents in multi-agent system achieve the global objective of the system by controlling the local parameters of individual agent. Self-organizing, self-steering and self-configuring capabilities are highly desired in the functioning of a distributed system. Nature inspired Flocking Algorithms have the potential to introduce these capabilities in the functioning of distributed system due to their inherent emergent behaviour. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, a novel algorithm is proposed for achieving self-organized circular formation control while tracking a target. Second, the proposed algorithm is analyzed for performance parameters and is found to be efficient. Simulations are carried out and the proposed algorithm is verified.

61|6859152|Conference Paper|2014|Teymur Sadikhov|Set-valued protocols for almost consensus of multiagent systems with uncertain interagent communication|One of the main challenges in robotics applications is dealing with inaccurate sensor data. Specifically, for a group of mobile robots the measurement of the exact location of the other robots relative to a particular robot is often inaccurate due to sensor uncertainty or detrimental environmental conditions. In this paper, we address the consensus problem for a group of agent robots with uncertain interagent communication. Measurement uncertainty is characterized by balls of radius r centered at the neighboring agents exact locations.We show that the agents reach an almost consensus state and converge to a time-varying ball of radius r and include an analysis approach to the problem based on set-valued analysis. Finally, several illustrative numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed set-valued consensus protocol framework.
61|4347395|Conference Paper|2007|Liu Chenglin|Consensus of Multi-agent System with Diverse Communication Delays|In this paper, a protocol is proposed to solve the consensus problem of multi-agent system with diverse communication delays. Sufficient conditions for the convergence to a consensus are obtained based on the frequency-domain analysis and matrix theory. The conditions depend on each agent';s self-delay, the weights of the edges to each agent';s neighbors, and the interconnection topology of the network. Under the proposed protocol, introducing self-delay can speed up the convergence rate for the system with communication delays. Moreover, the communication delays do not influence the convergence; they prolong the converging time instead. Simulation results illustrate the correctness of the results.

We examine some of the factors that can influence the dynamics of the learning process in such a setting. We first distinguish reinforcement learners that are unaware of (or ignore) the presence of other agents from those that explicitly attempt to learn the value of joint actions and the strategies of their counterparts. We study Q-learning in cooperative multi-agent systems under these two perspectives, focusing on the convergence to Nash equilibrium. We propose an exploration strategy to increase the likelihood of convergence to an optimal equilibrium.

A type of decentralized observer is designed for each following agent using the local output information. Then, a new adaptive fault estimator is constructed to estimate the real-time fault signal. Using the obtained state and fault information, a novel fault-tolerant control protocol is given to for stabilizing the closed-loop system. It is shown that the sufficient criteria established can ensure that the formation errors of each agent converges to a small set around the origin. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant formation control protocol.

In this paper, we used the fire panic problem and we have tried to be learned how agents escape from the fire. Also, we have observed agents behavior and checked a character of agent types. In the fire panic problem, a fire exists in a field, and progresses step by step this fire spreads. The objective of the agent is to reach a goal position without touching the fire. The fire is able to grown three power levels during a few steps in a field. The agent has to run away from a fire and get a goal: exit. Our purpose in this paper is the acquisition of behavior to reach a goal in a changing environment, in this paper, we observe how agents escape from the fire by cooperating with other agents. For this problem, we propose a unique CMAC-based Q-learning system for heterogeneous multi-agent systems.

In this paper, we further study the same problem for singular multi-agent systems subject to jointly connected switching networks. First, by introducing a static output feedback control, we remove the unnecessary standard assumption on the singular system in the existing result. Then, we derive a reduced-order normal multi-agent system and obtain a distributed output measurement feedback control law based on the existing result on the normal multi-agent system. Finally, we show that the composition of the static output feedback control law and the distributed output measurement feedback control law solves the cooperative output regulation problem for the original singular multi-agent system. Our result enlarges the class of systems whose cooperative output regulation problem is solvable.

61|7795079|Conference Paper|2016|Jinghan He|Digital substation backup protection using a multi-agent system approach|Traditionally, differential protections are used in a substation to protect important plants such as busbars and transformers. They are unit protection schemes which provide good selectivity and fast operating times, but do not provide backup capability. Backup protections are usually provided by overcurrent, under impedance or distance zone 2/zone 3 schemes. They are less discriminative, and because of the need to coordinate, they will need to operate with a relatively long time delay. Digital substation provides a process bus which allows information to be shared between protection devices. This has extended the capability of these devices, such that it is possible to change the traditional backup protection philosophy and to devise new schemes without excessive cost. This paper uses a multi-agent system (MAS) approach to model the interactions between protection devices and to develop new techniques for backup protection. The MAS system is developed using JADE (Java Advanced Development Environment), whilst PSCAD provides simulation for the power system. The boundaries of the unit protection schemes in a substation are extended to provide backup capability, with improved performance as compared to the traditional schemes. Simulations on the 110kV substation are used to illustrate and to validate this approach. Test scenarios with different failure mechanisms are used to show the cooperation and the self-healing properties of the MAS.
61|5369396|Conference Paper|2009|Cheng-Lin Liu|Consensus of Multi-agent Systems with Sampled Information and Input Delay|In this paper, the consensus problem is investigated for the second-order multi-agent systems with sampled information and input delay. Based on the frequency domain analysis, sufficient and necessary consensus conditions are obtained for the sampled-data system converging to the stationary consensus and the dynamical consensus respectively. The consensus condition depends on not only the input delay, but also the sampling interval. When the sampling interval is larger than the critical value, the system diverges without any relationship to the input delay. Simulation results illustrate the correctness of the results.
61|4681995|Conference Paper|2008|Ebrahim AlHashel|A Conceptual Agent Cooperation Model for Multi-agent Systems' Team Formation Process|Agent cooperation is the key advantageous feature of agent-oriented software (AOS) in comparison with all other software approaches. Agent cooperation process has the potential to dynamically form a team of agents, and then execute a plan to achieve a common goal. Applying the agent cooperation concept requires two software engineering tools: the first is the software development methodology that can design the cooperative agent-based system; the second is the agent cooperation model that can manage the team behaviour at runtime.This on-going research attempts to engineer the agent cooperation concept into two steps: the first step, the Prometheus development methodology is enhanced to acquire the capabilities to generate the agent team artefacts that will be consumed by the proposed cooperation model; in the second step, a conceptual cooperation model is developed. In regard to the complexity of agent cooperation process, the implementation part of the cooperation model held for further investigation.
61|9567863|Conference Paper|2021|Shihab Hamad Khaleefah|Exploring the Roles of Agents and Multi-Agent in Image Feature Extraction|In the interior of image texture analysis methods, many types, behavior, strategies, modeling, and characteristics are employed. Several surveys and reviews are illustrated in the literature regarding image texture and feature extraction using an agent and multi-agent-based systems. Nevertheless, few determinations are made in the context of the image texture feature extraction. Hence, the overall aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the image texture and feature extraction concepts depicted in the literature for characterizing regions in images by exploring the role and strategies of the agent and multi-agent systems (MAS). This paper tackles two behavior types, reactive agent (RA) and goal-directed agent (GDA), in terms of the natural surroundings of agent and multi-agent communications. In terms of MAS modeling, this paper tackles three types, including facilitator agent architecture (FAA), mediator agent architecture (MAA), an autonomous agent architecture (AAA). While for the MAS characteristics, five types are presented: interaction, coordination, cooperation, collaboration, and collectiveness. Finally, a discussion for agent and multi-agent-based feature extraction in image analysis is presented by comparing the strategies and the frequent use of the strategies in the literature. Based on this review, most of the feature extraction multi-agent-based systems rely on either coordinating or emergent-based strategies, while feature selection agent-based systems rely on collaborative strategies. However, there are several aspects that we can consider to be classified as agent-based strategies. This review develops a classification scheme for systems used in specific tasks of feature extraction.

SoS architecting deals with the way that independent components of a SoS can be dynamically structured and can change autonomously their interactions in an efficient manner to fulfill the goal of the SoS and to cope with an evolving environment. In this context we defined a new model called SApHESIA (SoS Architecting HEuriStIc based on Agents) focusing on the environment and its dynamics. We also proposed a cooperative heuristic to control interactions exchanges between components. These contributions are then instantiated to a case study and evaluated through two scenarii. Obtained results are finally discussed and some perspectives are given.
61|8825994|Journal Article|2019|Guangqiang Xie|A Distributed Consensus Protocol Based on Neighbor Selection Strategies for Multi-Agent Systems Convergence|Multi-agent systems (MASs), which consist of numerous mobile agents, is a promising research area in artificial intelligence that has been profusely applied to Engineering. A consensus problem of discrete time MASs with switching topology is investigated in this paper. First, a new distributed consensus protocol based on different neighbor selection strategies is proposed. In order to reach system consensus, the protocol requires each agent to intelligently refer to two neighbors for calculating and updating state. Compared with traditional protocol, the new protocol with different strategies can significantly reduce the cost of comparison, data storage and computation during MASs evolution. Next, three concrete neighbor selection strategies and an optimized strategy are designed. Then, we analyze and prove the stability of the protocol by Lyapunov theorem and Gerschgorin Theorem. The range of parameters, that affect reaching a consensus and equilibrium state in each strategy, is given in the proof. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new protocol and the convergence performance of MASs under different neighbor selection strategies and parameter settings.

In consequence, we apply the advanced multi-agent technology into the new WSEPGS, thus the project can improve the development of WSEPGS. Further more, it will realize utility of new energy, economic development as well as environmental protection.

Adadi|Modeling and simulation of Web Services composition based on MARDS model|Web services composition is an emerging paradigm for application integration within and across organizations and enterprises. A set of languages and techniques for web services composition has emerged and is continuously being enriched with new proposals from different vendors. Among these languages we remind Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) which emphasizes the importance of modelling and simulating of business process in Web Services composition. Multi-agent Systems (MAS) are composed of autonomous agents that interact and coordinate to achieve their intentions. This makes them particularly adapted to modelling composite and complex information systems. In this paper we propose a new approach for modeling and simulating the process of web services composition using the Multi-Agent Reactive Decisional System (MARDS) Model and BPEL Language.
61|7307996|Journal Article|2016|Zhirong Qiu|Quantized Leaderless and Leader-Following Consensus of High-Order Multi-Agent Systems With Limited Data Rate|Distributed consensus with limited communication data rate is an interesting and important problem and has been studied for multi-agent networks with the first order and second order integrator dynamics. However, the problem remains challenging for higher-order systems due to the complexity of consensus analysis and data rate minimization. In this paper, the leaderless and leader-following quantized consensus for a special kind of high-order systems are considered. Each agent is assumed to be controllable and observable with single input and single output, and its system matrix admits n identical eigenvalues of 1. The special case of n-th order integrator multi-agent system with only the first state variable being measurable is first investigated, and it is shown that for a fixed undirected connected network, n bits of information exchange between agents suffice to guarantee the leaderless and leader-following quantized consensus respectively with an exponential convergence rate by employing a suitable encoding-decoding scheme and perturbation analysis of matrices. The obtained results are then extended to the general case of multi-agent dynamics with n identical eigenvalues of 1 by applying the same encoding-decoding scheme and control protocol to an observer system for each agent. The final consensus value and the application to formation control are also discussed.

61|9187614|Journal Article|2020|Hui Wei|Flocking for Multiple Subgroups of Multi-Agents With Different Social Distancing|In this paper, considering the difference in social distancing among individuals, according to the extent of social distancing, a group composed of N mobile agents is divided into multiple different subgroups. Especially, from the perspective of differential game theory, the flocking problem of different subgroups can be regarded as collision avoidance between neighboring agents, or obstacle avoidance between agents and virtual static/dynamic obstacles. To explore the internal mechanism of this interesting problem, a novel flocking algorithm with multiple virtual leaders is designed. The proposed algorithm is a modified version of the traditional flocking and semi-flocking algorithms. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and LaSalle';s invariance principle, the stability analysis of the proposed algorithm is then proven. Furthermore, considering the complex environment that swarm robots or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may face when performing military missions such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and rescue, etc., we also investigate the flocking problem of multi-agents in both virtual static and dynamic obstacles environment. Finally, three kinds of simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

62|9468156|Conference Paper|2021|Jiayu Li|Sampled-Data-Based Consensus of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems Under DoS Attacks|This article focuses on the distributed sampled-data consensus of a generally linear multi-agent system exposed to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. When DoS attacks happen, blocking the transmission of the sampled signals through the communication network, no signal can be received by systems. We consider DoS attacks allowed to occur randomly with limited duration time. For MASs in which agent states are sampled periodically, logical processors embedded in the distributed controllers that can receive sampled signals and obtain attack information are introduced. The original system is then reformulated into an aperiodic sampled-data control system(SDCS) affiliated with the minimum and maximum limits of DoS attacks duration time. A distributed sampled-data control law against Dos attacks is developed based on the looped-Lyapunov functional approach and the free weight matrix method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed techniques is illustrated through a numerical example of a 4-agent system.

62|8267142|Journal Article|2019|Shiming Chen|Multitarget Tracking Control for Coupled Heterogeneous Inertial Agents Systems Based on Flocking Behavior|In this paper, the flocking behavior and targets consensus tracking problems of heterogeneous multiple inertial agents with limited communication ranges are investigated. Consider the inertial effect of real agents, a distributed control protocol is designed such that the agents can achieve stable group behaviors. Using the decomposition approach, the stability of a multiple inertial agents system is proved. Combining with the flocking behavior of multiple inertial agents, agents themselves are in charge of searching and choosing the target in an autonomous and individual way according to the relationship between velocities of agents and targets. An augmented distributed multiflocking method is proposed to guarantee that the multitarget consensus tracking can be reached for heterogeneous multiagent systems. It shows that the proposed control approach can not only ensure local flocking with pursuing agents, but also make heterogeneous agents consistently track the multitarget.
62|4441636|Conference Paper|2007|Kai Huang|Intelligent Agents Applied to Reconfiguration of Mesh Structured Power Systems|In this paper, the authors propose a multiagent system based reconfiguration methodology for mesh structured power systems. One of the important features of this multiagent architecture is that the intelligent agents in the multiagent system work in a completely decentralized manner. There is no central controller in the system. In this multiagent system, an agent can send/receive signals to/from a major electric component in the power system. Each agent only communicates with its immediate neighboring agents. A simulation platform is also introduced for validating the proposed reconfiguration methodology. In the simulation platform, the intelligent agents are implemented using Java agent development framework. The power system is implemented in a real time digital simulator. The simulation results show the proposed reconfiguration methodology is effective and promising.

In this paper, we present a new model that uses a trained neural network to build ontologies adapted from other ontologies in order to solve the problem of semantic interoperability between heterogeneous multi-agent systems (SMAs). The main idea is to attribute to each concept of a given SMA ontology an image label that indicates its semantic representation. To build a new adapted ontology, a trained neural network is used to interpret the ontology concepts of an existing source SMA.

62|4545345|Conference Paper|2008|Farshad Moradi|An Agent-Based Environment for Simulation Model Composition|As Modelling and Simulation gains more popularity, the demand on reducing time and resource costs associated with development and validation of simulation models has also increased. Composing simulation models of reusable and validated simulation components is one approach for addressing the above demand. This approach requires a composition process that is able to support a modeller with discovery and identification of components as well as giving feedback on feasibility of a composition. Software agents are programs that can with some degree of autonomy perform tasks on behalf of a user or another program. In a Multi Agent System (MAS) autonomous agents interact and collaborate with each other in order to solve complex problems that are beyond the individual capabilities or knowledge of each agent, thus providing modularity and scalability. The objective of this work has been to develop a Multi Agent System for discovery and composition of BOM (Base Object Model) based simulation models, which provides the flexibility and adaptability to test and assess, amongst others different discovery and composition methods and techniques.¬†¬†The MAS that we developed is based on the JACK‚Ñ¢ Intelligent Agents and executes a rule-based process for discovery and composition of BOMs. Our preliminary results indicate its feasibility, portability, adaptability and flexibility.

The mean of this work is to give a linear multi-objective program to modeling the synchronization bus timetabling problem. Our subject is to minimize the waiting time of passengers in the correspondence stations, thus, we aim to maximize the number of buses synchronized by giving a new meaning to the synchronization of two buses in the network. The complexity of the problem is mainly due to the use of a large research space, therefore, at the resolution level, we have used a multi-agent approach based on the metaphor of the coalition.
62|8028690|Conference Paper|2017|Yijing Xie|Event-triggered global leader-following consensus for multi-agent systems with bounded controls|This paper studies the global leader-following consensus problem for a multi-agent system using event-triggered bounded controls. Both the follower agents and the leader agent are described by a chain of integrators of an arbitrary length. An event-triggered control law is constructed for each follower agent and an event-triggering strategy is designed for updating the control laws. These event-triggered control laws are shown to achieve global leader-following consensus when the communication topology among the follower agents is connected and the leader is a neighbor of at least one follower agent. The absence of the Zeno behavior is established. A self-triggering strategy is also proposed to avoid continuous verification of the triggering condition. Simulation results are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

62|5228067|Conference Paper|2009|Rajdeep Niyogi|Planning with trial and errors|Agent-based systems have gained immense popularity in the last decade or so. Reasoning methods such as planning and decision-making under uncertainty applied to agents and multi-agent systems is an important area of research in agent-based systems. Most works in planning in uncertain environments incorporate sensing actions. We wish to address planning problems when there are no such sensing actions. For this, we introduce the notion of dasiatry actionspsila and develop a logic PDL_try that is an extension to propositional dynamic logic (PDL). The logic also allows specification of the implicit knowledge of an agent. We illustrate planning in our logic with a new adaptation of the popular blocks world domain.

Farazmand|Using a learning mechanism in matchmaking process of agents' negotiation in multi-agent systems|Negotiation between agents is an important aspect of the multi-agent systems'; efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to enhance the efficiency of the multi-agent systems by improving the negotiation between agents in such a system. Here, focus is on the matchmaking mechanism of negotiation in which a matchmaker agent is responsible to find a proper server agent in response to a request of a client agent. The matchmaker agent needs to have the complete knowledge about other agents and their responsibilities in all system. This paper at first proposed that the agents can be categorized in fuzzy groups by regarding previous experiences of their performance and it happens by using a learning module in system. Also determining membership function of an agent in groups is considered. So, the matchmaker agent needs to have the knowledge about fuzzy groups of agents, and refer the requests in the base of such knowledge. When the matchmaker wants to pass a message about a request, it selects an a-cut group of that fuzzy group and sends the message to them. This mechanism leads to lesser communication and message passing in the huge and or Web based systems, the lesser communication and message passing through the system will lead to more efficient system.

The system with edge dynamics is addressed by associating each edge of the network with a state variable. Firstly, we propose a new class of dynamic-edge multi-agent system based on the first-order integrator model and the rationality of this system is illustrated by the example of a power network system. Then, by discussing the relationship between Œª and 0 and the relationship between Œª and decay rate respectively, the controllability problem is investigated for the directed multi-agent system with both node dynamics and edge dynamics. With PBH criterion, necessary and sufficient conditions are finally derived for the controllability of the system.
62|8483145|Conference Paper|2018|Jiaxiang Zhang|Leader-Following Consensus Control for Complex Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems Without Velocity Measurements|This paper considers a leader-following consensus problem for complex heterogeneous multi-agent systems composed of the first-order linear, the second-order linear and the nonlinear Euler-Lagrange agents. First, we design a leader-following consensus control protocol with the active leader for multi-agent systems where the followers cannot obtain the velocity measurements. Then, according to the actual situation, the actuator saturation problem is solved as the special practical nonlinear problem by designing the actuator nonlinear consensus protocol. Based on Graph theory, Lyapunov theory and Barbalat';s Lemma, the effectiveness of controller is proved with a second-order dynamic of the leader under the undirected communication topological graph. Some simulation examples verify the validity of the conclusion.
62|5256737|Conference Paper|2009|Sara Boutamina|Multi agent-based system for the design of collaborative scripts|Collaborative learning is not always effective; its effects depend on the richness and intensity of interaction between students during the collaboration. This collaboration is structured using collaborative scripts. Hence, the design of these scripts is not trivial; it requires information on learners and on their interaction. We believe that when learners are the target of any design, this one needs to be evaluated on the basis of the learners themselves. However, most of the design approaches do not use experimental feedback on the learners'; collaboration to improve the initial design. We propose in this article a method for the design of scripts basing on the experimental feedback. We suggest the use of multi-agent systems to provide help and information to the scripts designers.
62|8571567|Conference Paper|2018|Hong-Kyong Kim|The Multi-agent Rendezvous using Gossip and Consensus Algorithms: Directed Bipartite Connection|The multi-agent system is a hot topic in control systems theory. Consensus algorithm and gossip algorithm are two main examples of multi-agent systems control. Consensus algorithm converges from different initial values of agents to a certain value in a given graph. Gossip algorithm is similar to consensus but the graph is randomly selected each time. In this paper, we propose a new concept of a cluster graph where it is composed of three parts: one set of agents with fixed connections, another set of agents with randomly selected connections, and lastly fixed edges connecting the two former mentioned sets. The Laplacian matrix and randomly averaging matrix are key points of the system equation. There are three cases of connections between two groups. We use lemmas to solve asymptotic stable convergence of the system. This simulation shows the asymptotic stable of 3 bipartite graph connections in a few seconds.
62|5946060|Conference Paper|2011|Sebla Demirkol|Development of an agent based e-barter system|A barter system is an alternative commerce approach where customers meet at a marketplace in order to exchange their goods or services without currency. In order to cope with challenges of electronic barter systems (e.g. efficient management of trades and determination of best-matching goods and their suppliers), several software systems based on intelligent agents have been proposed. However only a very few of these proposals consider exact development and implementation of multi-agent e-barter systems. Besides, most of the approaches consider matching between exchanged goods in which only price and quantity information are used. Hence, in this paper, we discuss design and implementation of a multi-agent e-barter system which utilizes ontology-based comparison for bid matching. Formal representation and decision-making criteria for agent mediated barter process are given and behavioral model of collaborating agents within the system is described. In addition to the traditional e-barter members, a new type of software agent is introduced in order to infer about semantic closeness between offered and purchased items. Related approach may enhance capabilities of e-barter systems in the way of finding the most appropriate matches between supplies and demands, considering not only price and quantities for goods.

62|5069962|Conference Paper|2009|Mehran Ziadloo|A framework to evaluate multi-objective optimization algorithms in multi-agent negotiations|Multi-objective optimization algorithms are designed to find Pareto frontier set. This set plays a major role in multi-agent systems'; negotiations. Different applications might be interested in different parts of Pareto frontier. In this paper we present a framework to show how a multi-objective optimization algorithm is evaluated against others. We used eleven algorithms implemented in MOMHLib++ library to test our framework on a two agent negotiation of binary issues and binary dependency. But our framework is easily expandable to higher number of objectives and all types of negotiations. Our analysis shows that a single scalarization value of Pareto frontier is not enough to compare multi-objective optimization algorithms, as it is done in most cases.

This paper introduces Mandala, a platform to support interoperability in SoS. Mandala aims to offer a software layer to integrate heterogeneous, independent information systems without significantly changing their implementation or even knowing details about each system. The proposal relies on (i) business process models to represent activities associated to SoS global missions and (ii) software agents to support asynchronous communication among autonomous components. This paper presents an evaluation of Mandala and its interoperability mechanisms through a case study using information systems within a smart city scenario.

The design and implementation of the prototype for wide-area backup protection in power system illustrate that the platform can provide bidirectional communication for wide-area cooperation agents and greatly improve the intelligence and flexibility of distributed system.
63|1489312|Conference Paper|2005|H.F. Wang|The "third-category" method and multi-agent system theory in power system applications|This paper discusses issues on how multi-agent system theory can be fitted into the framework of the proposed third-category power control method. An example of the third-category control implemented by a setting up multi-agent system to enhance power system voltage stability is demonstrated. To maintain stable operation of a power system, we have conventional means of preventive control and emergency control. When the power system is losing the stability, on-line control is still needed to maintain continuous operation of separated parts of power system to prevent the whole system from collapsing and to minimize the cost of black start. Implementation of such on-line control after emergency control fails can be called &#034;post-emergency&#034; control. This paper demonstrates the great potential of applying the third-category control method and multi-agent system for the post-emergency control, that shows the necessity and importance of the post-emergency control to minimize system loses.

The concept of autonomous agents fits most actors in transportation systems: the traffic, the expert, the driver. More so, traffic signals and intersection can also be regarded as an autonomous agent. Though, there are increased number of agents, typical agents make response to changes in their environment and are highly self-adaptive, but create an unpredictable collective pattern, and response in a highly coupled environment, most challenges for standard techniques are created by this domain in route guidance system from multi-agent systems such as reinforcement learning and self-adaptive. This research has two main goals in route guidance system: first, to present problems, methods, new approaches; and second, open problems and challenges are highlighted so that future research in route guidance system using multi-agent systems will be able to address them.

But because of incomplete information agents have, the efficiency of on-line negotiation protocol is rather low. To overcome the problem, an on-line agent bilateral multi-issue alternate bidding negotiation protocol based on reinforcement learning is present. The reinforcement learning algorithm is presented to on-line learn the incomplete information of negotiation agent to enhance the efficiency of negotiation protocol. The protocol is applied to on-line multi-agent based electronic commerce. In the protocol experiment, three kinds of agents are used to compare with, which are no-learning agents (NA), static learning agents (SA) and dynamic learning agent (DA) in this paper. In static learning agent, the learning rate of Q-learning is set to 0.1 unchangeable, so itpsilas called static learning. While in dynamic learning proposed in this paper, the learning rate of Q-learning can change dynamically, so itpsilas called dynamic learning. Experiments show that the protocol present in this paper can help agents to negotiate more efficiently.

In this note the event-based average consensus problem is studied. By appropriate event design, discontinuous threshold is employed and thus continuous communication among agents can be avoided to reduce energy consumption in practice. Moreover, it is showed that the proposed event-triggered control can achieve average consensus with fewer events and faster consensus rate compared with existing works. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Rigorous proofs are provided to show that the proposed algorithms achieve guaranteed convergence if specific conditions hold. A simulation example is presented to demonstrate the theoretical results.

In this paper, we present our work, which takes advantage of different technologies such as ontology and agent system for smart school management, especially in the classroom. This work is designed to help administrators to identify any activities that occur at the classroom level, such as tracking the attendance of the student or teacher. We use the ontology to model the context in an intelligent environment for facilitating information integration and knowledge sharing between heterogeneous knowledge and information sources in smart school.

63|8844827|Journal Article|2020|Ting Wang|Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems Under Binary-Valued Measurements and Recursive Projection Algorithm|This paper studies consensus problems of multi-agent systems with binary-valued communications. Different from most existing works, the agents considered in this paper can only get binary-valued observations of its neighbors'; states with random noises. A consensus algorithm is proposed: first, each agent estimates its neighbors'; states by the recursive projection algorithm; then, each agent designs the control timely based on the estimates. It is proved that the estimates of the states can converge to the true states with a faster convergence rate than that in the parameter estimation. Moreover, the states of the agents can achieve mean-square consensus, and the corresponding consensus speed can achieve O(1/t) under certain conditions. Finally, simulations are given to demonstrate the theoretical results.
63|9166670|Conference Paper|2020|Nurhayati Sembiring|Developing Multi-Agent Systems Using Agent-Based and Geographic Information System Simulation|One of the problems that resulted in the supply chain of durian was the arriving time of the product to costumer. If the product not delivered at the right time, the quality of the product will decrease. Due to this situation, the optimization of the logistics process is an essential aspect of operations in the supply chain system of durian. To estimate how long the product will arrive to the consumer can be obtained by performing a real system simulation and a software-based digital system. With the help of AnyLogic software, we model logistics process optimization based on discrete systems and agent-based Geographic Information System (GIS) simulations. The simulation produces a visualization of a real process model of the durian supply chain logistics, order time estimation, and supplier utility in durian distribution in North Sumatra province. Estimating model shows the estimated time of the order from the farm to the distributor location in Berastagi of 2.43 hours, Padang Bulan Medan 4.50 hours, Pematang Siantar 3.58 hours, Tebing Tinggi 4.33 hours, and Binjai 4.75 hours.
63|4365410|Conference Paper|2007|J. Chen|Simulating Plant Growth with Multi-Agent System|Virtual reality technique is widely used in pervasive computing. Plant model is a hotspot study issue in this area. It has been generally recognized that 3D plant model based on growth can make the morphologies of plants lifelike. The paper has put forward a plant growing model based on evolvement of multi-agent system. With multi-agent system, plant growing process can be really simulated. Usually, a plant has many growth points which are growing synchronously. Grow points grow out branches and leaves, and germinate new grow points. Grow points are independent in behavior and adaptable to circumstance, they compete and co-operate with each other, and finally form the shape of plant. So it is nature to employ an agent to simulate behavior of growth point, and employ a multi-agent system to simulate behavior of plant growth system.
63|4060539|Conference Paper|2006|Zhixin Liu|Connectivity and Synchronization of Multi-agent Systems|Collective behaviors of multi-agent systems are important starting points in the study of complex systems, and Vicsek';s model is a typical model of multi-agent systems. In addition to its simplicity, it preserves some key features of complex systems, such as dynamic behaviors, local interactions and changing neighborhood graph. Jadbabaie et al. analyzed the synchronization of a linearized Vicsek';s model, and showed that if a certain connectivity condition is satisfied, then all agents will move in the same direction eventually. An unresolved key problem is when such a connectivity is satisfied. In this paper, we will first show that each agent';s heading will converge in Vicsek';s model, and will then give a sufficient condition imposed only on the agents'; initial states and parameters to make Vicsek';s model synchronized. Finally, we will give a counterexample to show that connectivity of the neighbor graph is not sufficient for synchronization of the Vicsek';s model if the initial headings are allowed to be in [-œÄ, œÄ). This reveals an essential difference between the linearized Vicsek';s model and the original Vicsek';s model.
63|5656213|Conference Paper|2010|Jamal Elhachimi|Multi-agent system for radio resource management of a heterogeneous network|This paper presents a multi-agent hierarchy that takes advantages of a greedy algorithm in conjunction with a Taboo search method to solve the problem of distributing radio resources in a wireless network. By the maximum reuse of the same frequencies, the method allows sharing all resources between different RANs (Regional Radio Access Network), coordinating these RANs to facilitate grouping the frequencies in the lower part of the spectrum in order to allow a later new assignment and best improvement of neighborhood. The approach is based on a macro-level management taking the form of a hierarchical group of distributed agents in the network and handling all RANs in a localized region regardless of the operating band. Where each regional network is overseen by a supervisor agent and it associates an agent for each cell. Our approach has been tested on GRAPH benchmarks of frequency assignment of the CALMA project. The results obtained are equivalent to those of current methods but our approach shows more efficiency in terms of flexibility and autonomy.
63|5381059|Conference Paper|2009|R. Beheshti|A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Method to Support Multi-agent Negotiations|Negotiations are among the most common ways that agents in a multi-agent system use to reach agreements. Because negotiations commonly are multi-lateral and multi-issue, these processes become more difficult. In the real world applications this becomes more important where the autonomous agents involved in a negotiation should reach maximum payoff in minimum time. In this work a new negotiation mechanism is proposed that is based on the multi-objective genetic algorithms. Several measures are defined that can show fitness of an offer in the set of feasible offers that an agent can have in each round of negotiations. The results show that this method can be used in real applications and is competitive with existing approaches.
63|8869104|Conference Paper|2019|Rajanikanth N Kashi|Mitigating Byzantine Failures in Multi-agent based Dependable and Adaptable Avionics Software|With increase in air traffic year on year and recent advancements and proliferation of unmanned aircraft systems, there is an increased drive and pressure to provide efficient and collaborative systems that leverage actionable information available on these ariel platforms. Adaptive systems forming the backbone of such platforms and adaptivity engineered through intelligent software agents is an attractive proposition as these ariel platforms operate in increasingly connected environments along with a number of other onboard systems collaboratively. This environment poses risks and a new set of problems wherein the adaptive system engineered with agents could fail, since some of these agents could be malicious. Byzantine faults form an important class of problems, contributing to these failures. Since the domain of avionics encompasses mission, safety, and flight critical systems, we provide one scheme that forms the basic block providing fault tolerance for byzantine failures caused by a single entity. A second scheme uses concepts from the signal-processing domain to over-come byzantine failures that involve multiple masquerading agents. We discuss the incorporation of these schemes in an exemplar adaptive flight planning system and provide reasoning for their correctness.

The use of VDM (Vienna Development Method) to specify a system is a well known practice in formal methods. We focus on covering uncovered defects that would likely go unnoticed with traditional specification methods. This paper presents an approach for the specification of multi-agent application and formal specification language which is used for specification of multi-agent application in VDM. Formal Specification can describe the problem in a better way as compared to pure English. At the beginning we will look at the case study which involves multi-agents. Our Pursuit Problem allows us to go through the characteristics of multi-agent system which will be specified with the help of VDM. The paper specifies and illustrates the data type with their invariants and function with their pre and post condition in accordance with the case study.

Without the requirement of knowledge of uncertainties of agents and controllers, adaptive distributed controllers are constructed to guarantee the follower agents tracking the leader agent. Asymptotic consensus results of multi-agent systems can be obtained under the influence of uncertainties in agents and controllers based on Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a multiple coupled aircrafts is used to verify the efficiency of the method.

In this paper, a fuzzy-based approach for partner selection in multi-agent systems is proposed. By employing both the fuzzy logic and the extended dual concern model, agents can adapt their individual behaviors for partner selection in negotiation. The proposed approach has three merits, which are: (1) both the agent';s own benefit and its potential partners'; benefits are considered for partner selection in negotiation; (2) by employing the extended dual concern model, agents'; attitudes to its potential partners are considered for partner selection in negotiation; and (3) by employing the fuzzy logic, the proposed partner selection approach can be applied in open and dynamic environments easily and flexibly, and the selection results are much more accurate and reasonable.

63|6675035|Journal Article|2014|Bin Zhang|On Weak-Invariance Principles for Nonlinear Switched Systems|In this technical note, we develop two weak-invariance principles for nonlinear switched systems. We first present a union weak-invariance principle for switched systems which includes as a special case the integral invariance principle. It is shown that the switched solution approaches the largest weakly invariant set of the combined zero loci of the output functions. Then, we extend the union weak-invariance principle to an intersection weak-invariance principle, which greatly reduces the convergence region. Unlike the existing results, in which the constructions of Lyapunov functions are inevitable, our principles do not require the existence of Lyapunov functions. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of our principles, as well as applications to multi-agent consensus problems.

Efficient, reliable fault identification and management has become a critical factor in the design of these increasingly sophisticated and complex devices.Teams of co-operating software agents are one way to co-ordinate the flow of diagnostic information gathered during fault-finding. By wielding domain knowledge of the software architecture used to construct the system, agents build and refine their beliefs about the location and root cause of faults.This paper examines how agents constructed within the GORITE Multi-Agent Framework create and refine their beliefs. We demonstrate three different belief structures implemented within our Fault Diagnostic Engine, showing how each supports a distinct aspect of the agent';s reasoning. Using domain knowledge of the IEC 61499 Function Block architecture, agents are able to examine and rigorously evaluate both individual components and entire sub-systems.

The authors began with describing the architecture for OSA-CBM. Then indicated that there were inherent limitations in model-based method and data-driven method adopted in maintenance decision-making and suggested the Multi-Agents method which is widely applied in many domains may be a proper choice. The components of Maintenance Decision-Making Agent (MDA) were presented in detail. On the analysis of Remaining Life Prediction Agent, Opportunistic Maintenance actions was proposed, which will help to turn the reactive maintenance philosophy to scheduled or preventive maintenance philosophy. It was proved that the capability of cooperation, interaction and parallel processing of autonomous agents had been greatly improved. The Multi-Agents model for maintenance decision-making was more effective in achieving the intelligence of the system.
64|1158672|Conference Paper|2002|G. Pour|Integrating agent-oriented enterprise software engineering into software engineering curriculum|Agent-oriented enterprise software engineering (AOESE) has emerged as a promising approach to developing Web-based enterprise software systems. AOESE is based on developing and evolving enterprise software systems from selected pre-engineered and pre-tested software agents, and then assembling them within appropriate software architectures. We view agent-oriented software engineering as an extension of conventional component-based software engineering, and software agents as next-generation software components. Software agents offer greater flexibility and adaptability than traditional components. However, making transition to agent-oriented enterprise software engineering requires software engineers to learn a new set of technical skills. To provide such a learning opportunity, the author has created a new course sequence that integrates both agent-oriented enterprise software engineering and component-based enterprise software engineering into software engineering curriculum. A new course in the sequence is intended to provide students with the opportunity to acquire a good understanding of the key concepts and principles of agent-oriented enterprise software engineering, and the new opportunities and challenges involved in developing Web-based multi-agent systems. The course is designed to help build a solid foundation for integration of research into education in the area of agent-oriented enterprise software engineering. The course has special emphasis on developing architectures and frameworks for Web-based multi-agent enterprise systems rather than developing single agent. In this paper, the author shares her experience of developing the course, and presents the course organization, its components, and the future plans for the course.
64|7798789|Conference Paper|2016|Guipu Li|Output consensus of double-integrator multi-agent systems with mismatched disturbances via SMC and GPIO|Most of the existing results on anti-disturbance consensus control of multi-agent systems focus on matched-disturbance rejection and the disturbances are assumed to be constant or slowly time-varying. This paper investigates the consensus control problem of double-integrator multi-agent systems with mismatched disturbances, which can be some kinds of faster time-varying disturbances, such as ramp and higher-order disturbances. To estimate the higher-order disturbances and their derivatives, for each agent, a generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO) is constructed. By distributedly employing the disturbances estimates, a kind of nonlinear sliding-mode surfaces are developed for both leaderless and leader-follower multi-agent systems. Based on the proposed surfaces and the disturbances estimates, composite consensus protocols are designed for both cases, which guarantee the global asymptotical stability of the consensus error systems.

Based on the Taylor approximation of the nonlinear multiagent system, a distributed semi-cooperative switch-mode filter is developed to get the minimum-variance unbiased (MVU) estimation of the unknown inputs and states. Compared with the conventional decentralized EKF-based unknown input filter, the proposed distributed filter has a more relaxed existence condition, which makes it more applicable in reality. This new type of filter is then successfully applied to the simultaneous estimation of state of charge (SOC) and temperature of a battery pack for battery management of electric vehicles and grid-tied energy storage systems.
64|1544974|Conference Paper|2005|Y. Takahashi|Simultaneous learning to acquire competitive behaviors in multi-agent system based on a modular learning system|Existing reinforcement learning approaches have been suffering from the policy alternation of others in multiagent dynamic environments. A typical example is the case of RoboCup competitions because other agent behaviors may cause sudden changes in state transition probabilities in which constancy is needed for the learning to converge. The keys for simultaneous learning to acquire competitive behaviors in such an environment are: a modular learning system for adaptation to the policy alternation of others; and an introduction of macro actions for simultaneous learning to reduce the search space. This paper presents a method of modular learning in a multiagent environment in which the learning agents can simultaneously learn their behaviors and adapt themselves to the situations as a consequence of the others'; behaviors.
64|8540560|Conference Paper|2018|Shihab Hamad Khaleefah|A General Framework of Multi-Agent Features Extraction Operators for Deformed Images Identification|Texture extraction of images is a core step in image pattern recognition applications. Different operators are applied for image texture extraction in order to obtain a unique identification of an image texture based on physical characteristics of the images. These operators are categorized into local and global texture analysis descriptors. This categorization is based on the properties of the operators and their features extraction methodology. However, each operator of a type has its strength and weakness in handling the deformations of the images including rotation, shear, region of interest, noise and variance of intensity. Subsequently, there is no operator that can perfectly handle all the deformation problems. To this end, this paper proposes a general framework of a Collaborative Multi-Agent Feature Extraction (CMAFE). The CMAFE framework deploys a multi-agent system to perform dynamic collaborations between the feature extraction operators. The operators are formed in a multi-agent system in which each agent implements an operator. This collaboration between the agents is based on a divide and conquer strategy. This strategy enables the operators to cope with the various challenges of deformations that are affecting the accuracy of the identification. The framework is meant to improve the image identification accuracy and reduce the universal search space of local and global operators which in return reduce the computational cost and time.

64|7294103|Conference Paper|2015|Meng Guo|Bottom-up motion and task coordination for loosely-coupled multi-agent systems with dependent local tasks|We propose a bottom-up motion and task coordination scheme for loosely-coupled multi-agent systems under dependent local tasks. Instead of defining a global task for the whole team, each agent is assigned locally a task as syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic formulas that specify both motion and action requirements. Inter-agent dependency is introduced by collaborative actions of which the execution requires multiple agents'; collaboration. The proposed solution contains an offline initial plan synthesis, an on-line request-reply messages exchange and a real-time plan adaptation algorithm. It is distributed in that any decision is made locally based on local computation and local communication within neighboring agents. It is scalable and resilient to agent failures as the dependency is formed and removed dynamically based on the plan execution status and agent capabilities, instead of pre-assigned agent identities. The overall scheme is demonstrated by a simulated scenario.

The control and measurement signals are processed by hysteretic quantizers to avoid chattering. The agent dynamics are described by a nonlinear uncertain model with immeasurable states, unmodeled dynamics, and disturbances. To estimate the immeasurable states and solve uncertainties, state observers are designed by utilizing dynamic high-gain technique. With the state observer, a distributed output feedback controller is developed for multi-agent systems by using the quantized measurements of the relative positions of the agents and the quantization effect on the control system is eliminated. The stability analysis proves that the proposed controller can achieve the multi-agent formation tracking, and all the closed-loop signals are bounded. By using the MATLAB/Simulink software, experimental results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

With the coverage control, it is able to deploy agents in the coverage area with arbitrary distribution based on the purpose of control. However, when initial position of agents concentrates on one location, it could be fallen into the local optimal solution (local optimal problem). While the local optimal problem, agents could not achieve the distribution based on the purpose of control. Meanwhile, random-walk takes vectorial angle randomly and move constant distance. By using this movement, it is possible to disperse the initial position of UAVs. Therefore, the local optimal problem could be solved by combining random-walk to coverage control. Moreover, using the artificial potential method as a repulsive force to avoid the collision between agents. This paper verifies the validity of proposed method by numerical simulation.

The outcome of this paper provides a novel approach to solidifying agent to agent trustworthy communication.

In previous literatures, it is often assumed that the agents communicate through Markov switching networks. However, in some engineering applications, the available network information is the expectation of the Laplacian matrix and the time-varying networks are not proper to be regarded as Markov switching. To solve this problem, we develop a method to cope with the mean square consensus of multi-agent systems. Based on the properties of expectation of Laplacian matrix, we present the design of relevant parameters and establish some conditions to guarantee the mean square consensus. Numerical simulations are also given to validate our approach.

So it makes system more robust.
64|1427102|Conference Paper|2005|W. Feurzeig|Adaptation and learning in software agents|Current software agent systems do only what they are programmed to do. Their capabilities extend very little beyond that. Our thesis is that software agents need to be driven by purposes in order to evolve the ability to adapt and learn. We have been developing agent systems whose intrinsic elements are purpose structures. Our goal is to extend both the theoretical foundation and the practical application of adaptive learning behavior in agent systems. We seek to work toward the development of systems that ultimately evolve learning as an emerging phenomenon. This paper describes our recent work under the DARPA TASK program in which we explored the use of purpose-based control structures as the conceptual framework underlying agent system behavior in a variety of complex tasks including adaptive traffic light control and adaptive UAV surveillance in heterogeneous dynamic operational environments. Our work in the latter area is presented here.
64|8852104|Conference Paper|2019|Tianyi Xiong|Adaptive Neural Network Time-varying Formation Tracking Control for Multi-agent Systems via Minimal Learning Parameter Approach|This paper investigates the time-varying formation tracking control problem for multi-agent systems with consideration of model uncertainties. For each dimension of an agent, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is first adopted to approximate the model uncertainties online. Taking the square of the norm of the neural network weight vector as a newly developed adaptive parameter, a novel RBFNN-based adaptive control law with minimal learning parameter (MLP) approach is then constructed to tackle the time-varying formation tracking problem. The uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of formation tracking errors is guaranteed through Lyapunov analysis. Compared with other traditional RBFNN-based formation tracking control laws for multi-agent systems, very few parameters need to be updated online in our proposed one, which can greatly lessen the computational burden. Finally, comparative simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed adaptive control law.
64|7817075|Conference Paper|2016|Eduardo Augusto Silvestre|An Approach to Verify Conflicts among Multiple Norms in Multi-agent Systems|In multi-agent systems, norms are being used to regulate the behavior of the autonomous agents. Norms describe the actions that can be performed, must be performed, and cannot be performed in the system. One of the main challenges on developing normative systems is that norms may conflict with each other. Norms are in conflict when the fulfillment of one norm violates the other and vice-versa. In previous works, the conflict checkers consider that conflicts can be detected by simply analyzing pairs of norms. However, there may be conflicts that can only be detected when we analyze several norms together. In this paper, we present a conflict checker that is able to check direct conflicts among multiple norms and a strategy developed to minimize the complexity of such problem, since the checking of multiple norms is a NP-hard problem. The algorithms are presented, a discussion about its complexity is provided and the validation of the conflict checker is described.

The control objective of the group of ASV agent is to maintain a certain formation in a predefined geometric pattern, notably a symmetric formation shape. In addition, the centroid of this to-be-sustained formation is to follow a designated leader agent whose dynamics resembles that of its followers. The contribution made in this paper is the introduction of an adaptive law capable of adjusting the strength of the state consensus control. Despite of partial information available to subset of agents, the formation control objective can still be achieved. The control scheme features a robustification term owed by a signum function which forces the state consensus error to zero. The control scheme is verified through numerical simulation which shows convergence of state consensus error to zero.

By using a distributed adaptive observer for the agents to estimate the exogenous signal, a distributed adaptive controller is designed. Compared with the existing works, one main contribution of this paper is that the proposed control schemes can be designed and implemented by each agent in a fully distributed fashion for general directed graphs.

65|668153|Conference Paper|1998|S. Abeck|A management architecture for multi-agent systems|Agents do have certain properties, such as autonomy, learning or mobility, which are useful to design and implement complex distributed applications. A multi-agent system is a network of cooperating agents each covering a well-defined and restricted part of the solution. Although agents are in principle autonomous they have to be monitored and controlled which is the task of the management of the multi-agent system. With the example of a Virtual Project Office a concrete multi-agent system and its management issues are illustrated. We introduce a management architecture which starts from existing and widely accepted concepts from the area of integrated network and systems management. One innovative aspect of the management architecture is given by the decision to model the management components of the architecture as non-mobile agents. This results in a simple and homogeneous integration of management functionality into the multi-agent system.
65|4721799|Conference Paper|2008|Quan Liu|A Collaborative Production Planning Model for Multi-agent Based Supply Chain|A supply chain (SC) is a world-wide complex network of suppliers, factories, warehouses, distribution centers and retailers. Due to the features of its production planning: distribution, autonomy, synchronism and openness, the traditional methods of production planning are unable to meet the demands of supply chain production planning (SCPP). Under collaborative environment, in order to eliminate conflicts generated among different enterprises planning, SCPP needs to integrate and use all the resources in the supply chain from the whole layout view. Based on the analysis of multi-agent technology and the characteristics of SCPP, an multi-agent based model of supply chain network is proposed, in which the functional and physical entities of the system are encapsulated by various kinds of agents. Then the multi-agent based production planning model is established and discussed. As a whole, the model can be divided into three layers: the overall production panning, sub-production planning in enterprise and detailed production planning of tasks. It breaks through the limitations of traditional methods, excellently reflects the information-sharing and resource-sharing principles of supply chain and can effectively support the collaborative production planning in supply chain.

Hoelz|A Cooperative Multi-agent Approach to Computer Forensics|This article proposes the use of a collaborative multi-agent approach to develop a toolkit to assist the experts during the forensic examination process: MADIK - a Multi-Agent Digital Investigation ToolKit. The use of a multi-agent approach has been proved adequate, specially regarding the cooperative action of the autonomous specialized agents: HashSetAgent, FilePathAgent, TimelineAgent, FileSignatureAgent. Also the distributed nature of the multi-agent approach allows for better usage of computational resources, since agents can operate autonomously in different machines and environments. As part of our work, we have defined a four layer multi-agent architecture, as a metaphor to the organizational hierarchy levels, which is divided in strategic, tactical, perational and specialist levels. The proposed architecture was the base to the development of the toolkit, which was developed with a blackboard approach, implemented over the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework - JADE, using Java Expert System Shell - JESS. We have done some experiments with MADIK using real data and the results are encouraging. This paper focuses on the benefits of using the multi-agent approach to aid in the forensic examination process, specially regarding the cooperative action of the autonomous specialized agents, which we deem as a flexible and promising possibility that should be further explored in the computer forensics scenario.
65|5334044|Conference Paper|2009|Hyo-Sung Ahn|Iterative learning control for multi-agent formation|This paper employs iterative learning control scheme to generate a sequence of control signals for multi-agent formation control. It is assumed that individual agent of a group of multi-agents is governed by nonlinear dynamics, which could be known in part; in such case, we would like to find control sequences of individual agents such that they form a desired formation with respect to other agents, from initial starting points to final stop points. That is, we would like to ensure that the multi-agents form relative desired states with respect to other agents along the desired trajectory. The algorithm established in this paper can be used to find a control sequence of multi-agent systems for keeping relative formation, in off-line tuning manner. The utility of the algorithm established in this paper can be therefore used for finding optimal control strategy of nonlinear dynamic systems with partially available system information.

These are based on theories and mathematical notations that allow the formal specification of a program and check its implementation. They offer a global vision and a high-level structure and system organization. In addition, the software architecture plays a key role as a pivot point between the requirements of a system and its implementation.

The proposed approach supports both the static and dynamic aspects of BDI-MAS architectures at different levels of abstraction. Further, we use automatic proof tool BigMc to analyze the specifications and verify system properties.

Different from the node-based method in the literature, an event-triggered control scheme based on the edge Laplacian framework is constructed. Under the edge framework, the rendezvous problem can be easily solved by stabilizing the equilibrium of the corresponding edge system to zero. Then the relative state constraint is equivalent to the constraints on the edge state dynamics, and can be satisfied by restraining it to a invariant constrained set. Finally, an edge-based event-triggered controller with both disturbances compensation and constraints satisfaction is designed. System stability is proved by Lyapunov stability theory, the Zeno-behaviour phenomenon is also avoided. Numerical example shows the effectiveness of the results.

Moreover, results are also given for the moving target set with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random switching, too.

All followers are assumed to be non-introspective, i.e., they have no self-knowledge, and only receive relative output information from neighbors. First, both the desired formation and the formation reference, i.e., the leader';s output trajectory, can be time-varying. Then, we provide the sufficient conditions for the existence of a distributed controller to guarantee the adaptive time-varying output formation-tracking of heterogeneous MAS with an unknown leader. Finally, we develop a time-varying L

65|8605757|Conference Paper|2018|Farzam Fanitabasi|A Review of Adversarial Behaviour in Distributed Multi-Agent Optimisation|This paper addresses the challenges of distributed multi-agent optimisation, in environments with potential adversarial agents. In distributed multi-agent optimisation, each agent has a local cost function and the collective goal is to optimise the global cost function, which takes as input, the output of each agent';s local cost function. Such optimisation algorithms are used in different fields such as distributed machine learning, distributed robotics, and recently, distributed energy planning. A prominent assumption in most of these algorithms is that all the agents are cooperative, non-faulty, and non-adversarial. Yet, in scenarios with multi-agent systems, such assumptions are not always valid. Recently, there has been some research in the area of resilience and fault-tolerant distributed multi-agent optimisation. However, these studies either assume a fully Byzantine environment, or have their own adversary model with different sets of assumptions about adversary capabilities. This makes the analysis and comparison between the results challenging. This paper presents a review of such algorithms which helps in defining and investigating restricted adversarial behaviour in distributed multi-agent optimisation. In comparison to the Byzantine environments which carry no assumptions about the agent';s capability or purpose, in this paper adversaries have restrictions in regard to their knowledge, capabilities, purpose, and impact. This approach makes it easier to provide guarantees about the system performance depending on the specific adversary model and avoid the overly conservative, ';one size fits all'; algorithms needed in fully Byzantine environments. Moreover, using the gained insights, previously unexplored aspects of adversarial behaviour in distributed multi-agent optimisation are discovered and indicated as possible future research directions.

Butler-Purry|Multi-agent technology for self-healing shipboard power systems|Shipboard electric power systems (SPS) are dynamic, complex systems that require continuous monitoring and fast controls to operate in a reliable and secure state. A self-healing system for SPS was developed using common programming languages to arm SPS to monitor and respond to threats and natural system failures.

A potential implementation of one function in the self-healing system using MAS is presented. It is concluded that the characteristics of MAS provide a natural framework for developing a self-healing methodology for SPS that is automated and enhances fight-through survivability

66|5477758|Conference Paper|2010|Li Chunfa|Used product remanufacturing information gathering system based on multi-agent|Remanufacturing represents a higher form of reuse by focusing on value-added recovery, rather than materials recovery. However, the management of remanufacturing information can differ greatly from traditional manufacturing. The information of used products are more complex for remanufacturing due to uncertainties from stochastic product returns, imbalances in return and demand rates, and the unknown condition of returned products. The technology of multi-agent is a good method of human interaction with machine; it can gather complex information. According to the analysis of the information that impacts on remanufacturing, an information gathering system model of remanufacturing products based on multi-agent system was present in this paper.

66|8449154|Conference Paper|2018|Binsen Qian|Multi-Robot Coordination Through Mobile Agent|Robots can protect humans from risk in many applications, such as search and rescue, outer-space exploration, and toxic cleanup. Multi-robot systems have a huge potential to benefit versatile applications through reconfiguring heterogeneous or homogeneous robots in different ways. This paper presents the design and implementation of RoboCoop, a mobile agent-based framework for automatic coordination of multi-robot systems. RoboCoop consists of several modules, such as knowledge base, Input/Output, task procession/execution, and-sensor reading. The agent-based framework utilizes the innate advantages of themulti-threading of each agent, such that each module can run persistently without blocking others. Modules can exchange information and data through inter-agent communication based on the standards of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA). The presented framework allows robots to coordinate, manage, and execute tasks automatically. Also, a backup mechanism is developed to ensure the robustness of robot systems. Moreover, it allows customized algorithms and strategies for task allocation, and execution. A box-pushing mission has been studied to validate the performance of the proposed cooperation framework in several folds, such as task allocation, path planning and motion synchronization. In this validation, boxes need to be assigned to a two-robot team for them to push to a designated position. The A* path planning algorithm is used for robots to drive to the box location. While the robot can push small boxes independently, the big boxes require two robots pushing simultaneously such that the box can move straight to the location.

66|6013442|Conference Paper|2011|Huang Qiaoliang|A novel navy ship power system restoration using multi-agent approach|A reconfiguration system is needed to solve power balance problems and try to satisfy vital loads as much as possible. And it is important to restore the power system as soon as possible to a target network configuration after the fault, especially after combat damage occurs. Current reconfiguration techniques are centralized methods and cannot meet the Navy';s needs for fight-through survivability and high reliability [1]. This paper presents a novel multi-agent based reconfiguration approach to perform system restoration for navy ship. Each zone agent in this system communicates with other agents. With the same global information and the same target, all zone agents use the same algorithm and collaborate with each other to achieve the reconfiguration objective as soon as possible.

The main contribution of this paper is to prove in a constructive way that a gradient-descent coordination control law designed for single integrators can be easily modified to adapt for various motion constraints such as nonholonomic dynamics, linear/angular velocity saturation, and other path constraints while preserving the convergence of the entire multiagent system. The proposed approach is applicable to a wide range of coordination tasks such as rendezvous and formation control in two and three dimensions. As a special application, the proposed approach solves the problem of distance-based formation control subject to nonholonomic and velocity saturation constraints.

Hariri|A Decentralized Multi-Agent System for Management of En Route Electric Vehicles|Being energy producers and consumers (prosumers), electric vehicles introduce new challenges to the operation of the electricity grid. With the anticipated increase of the market for electric vehicles in the near future, systems that set rules to manage and organize their large-scale penetration into the power grid are needed. As the Internet of Things (IoT) vision evolves, the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) shall be a stepping-stone for establishing a link between the well-known hierarchical smart grid control architecture (primary, secondary, and tertiary control) and the emerging layer of the EVs as dynamic and mobile energy prosumers. Against this background, this paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent system designed for the management of en route connected electric vehicles. In this framework, each electric vehicle and electric vehicle park is equipped with an intelligent agent. These agents interact with a higher-level agent responsible for managing charging requests within their geographical area. The importance of this multiagent framework is demonstrated in a case study, where electric vehicles are routed to the most suitable electric vehicle charging parks in their vicinity in a manner that satisfies the charging preferences of customers, with the lowest cost possible, while ensuring that the generation-load balance at the EV parks is not violated.

The communication topology of multi-agent systems switches within a finite set of digraphs which depicts the communication structure between agents. One case of topology set is considered: there does not exist a directed spanning tree for each of the topologies but there exists a directed spanning tree for the union of all the topologies. By a linear transformation, the formation problem is transformed into stability analysis of a switched delay systems. With the help of a stabilizing switching law, sufficient conditions for multi-agent systems to achieve a given formation under switching topologies are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A formation example of intelligent vehicle system is shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the switching strategies.

The specially designated formation occurs during the inter-task idle time in order to minimize the reconfiguration time. The basic specially designated formation is designed for dotted agents based on the optimal mapping relationships and current probabilities of the predefined formations. Then, the reconfiguration schemes are developed with the agents modeled as circles or ellipses to account for their physical shapes, and the problem of agent overlapping during the formation is addressed. Examples and simulation results are presented to analyze and demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the new design techniques.

66|6690804|Conference Paper|2013|David Sanderson|Interactions of Multiple Self-Adaptive Mechanisms in Multi-agent Systems|The macro-level properties of a system may emerge from the micro-level behaviour of individuals in the system. There have been numerous suggestions for the addition of meso-level structures as a way to guide this emergence towards desirable outcomes or away from undesirable ones. However, it can be observed that the interaction of the micro and meso levels may cause unexpected properties to arise at all levels of the system. This paper investigates the interleaving of a self-adaptive micro level with a self-organising meso level to explain the macro-level system properties that may occur. A simulation-based test bench is used to perform experiments examining various compositions of adaptive mechanisms at the micro and meso levels of a multi-agent system. The results of these experiments are then analysed using a proposed formalism for multi-level adaptive systems to explain the observed interactions.

66|8616447|Conference Paper|2018|Shafiqul Islam|Consensus Based Distributed Robust Adaptive Control for Second-Order Nonlinear Multi-agent Systems with Uncertainty|In this paper, we investigate consensus based distributed robust adaptive tracking control strategy for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems. The design only uses the states of the neighboring agents with directed communication topology in the presence of uncertainty. Robust and adaptive control algorithms are used for each agent to deal with uncertainty associated with leader input and follower agent dynamics. Lyapunov, Graph and sliding mode control theory uses to show that the proposed distributed cooperative design can reach an agreement with follower agents and track the states of the leader asymptotically. Analysis shows that robust consensus algorithm can force the states of the followers to track the sliding surface and remain there. In contrast with existing distributed design, the proposed consensus controller does not require the bound of the dynamical uncertainty and leader input for the follower agents. Evaluation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed design for real-time application.
67|9130792|Journal Article|2021|Wei Jiang|Consensus of General Linear Multi-Agent Systems With Heterogeneous Input and Communication Delays|This letter studies the consensus tracking control for multi-agent systems (MASs) of general linear dynamics considering heterogeneous constant known input and communication delays under a directed communication graph containing a spanning tree. First, for open-loop stable MASs, a distributed predictive observer is proposed to estimate the consensus tracking error and to construct the control input that does not involve any integral term (which is time-efficient in calculation). Then, using the generalized Nyquist criterion, we derive the conditions for asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system and show that is delay-independent. Subsequently, another observer is designed that allows the MASs to be open-loop unstable. Next, we use the generalized Nyquist criterion to compute the observer‚Äôs gain matrix. Towards this end, we choose a specific structure with which the problem boils down to computing a single parameter, herein called the predictive observer parameter. Two algorithms are proposed for choosing this parameter: one for general linear systems and one for monotone systems. To the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, this is the first work for which asymptotic convergence of consensus is proven for general linear MASs with arbitrary heterogeneous delays. Finally, the validity of our results is demonstrated via a vehicle platooning example.

Tillett|Cooperation of decision-theoretic agents in the context of multi-agent systems|Multi-agent based solutions to problems, whether they are software agents or physical robots, are attractive because they are robust and scalable. Fundamental aspects of designing multi-agent systems involve modeling the intelligence of the agents and modeling their interactions. The intelligences of agents modeled here are encoded in Bayesian representations of their world. The agents interact only by observing others and moving in such a way so as to probabilistically maximize their internalized goal or utility. Using this multi-agent framework, a three agent herding is explored.

One of ways is to solve a system of corresponding automata equations. Since in general, the complexity of solving such equations is exponential w.r.t. to the number of states of the context and specification, the question arises whether a system of equations can be reduced to a single equation. In this paper, we consider two special cases when a system of equations under the parallel composition over Finite State Machines can be reduced to a single equation. For each case, it is shown how a corresponding single equation can be derived.

Assume one local objective function can only be known by one agent. Based on the local neighbors'; information, a new distributed optimization algorithm with nonuniform gains is proposed. By a new coordination transformation, the closed-loop system can be decomposed into two one-order system. It is proved that all agents can reach an agreement and the team objective function can be minimized by analyzing these two one-order systems. Finally, a simulation example ia given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The adaptive event-triggered controller does not rely on the global topology information of multi-agent systems, and can deal with the unknown nonlinearities of system dynamics. Unlike previous related works, our adaptive event-triggered consensus controller is firstly designed for unknown second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems. Benefiting from the event-triggered strategy, the multi-agent systems do not need continuous communications and save the bandwidth and energy resources. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our consensus protocol.
67|4052943|Conference Paper|2006|Wei Wang|An Autonomous Trust Construction System Based on Bayesian Method|Though research on multi-agent systems have progressed at a steady pace, its promise has yet to be realized. One major difficulty is that, by its very nature, the multi-agent system is a large, uncensored system. This raises the question of how much dependability to give each information source. We cannot expect each user to know the trustworthiness of each source. Trust mechanism is regarded as a key for solving the problem of security in multi-agent systems. To achieve the trust management autonomy, this paper presents an autonomous trust construction model based on Bayesian method. The presented model adopts the Bayesian method to evaluate the trust value of each agent, and uses the graph theory to combination and path searching to construct the trust relation. The simulation experiment results prove that the autonomous trust construction is effective.
67|9507194|Conference Paper|2021|Galina V. Verkhova|Distributed Multi-agent Modeling of Complex Systems|Multi-agent modeling of complex systems is a task that requires the representation of knowledge from various fields of science and technology, as well as the formalisms that provide such a representation. Multi-agent modeling requires the creation of complex software that provides the representation of knowledge from various fields of science and technology, the integration of this knowledge into a single system, as well as significant computing power. The problem of multi-agent modeling of complex systems requires the use of methods and technologies of distributed modeling. The article describes an approach to distributed multi-agent modeling of complex systems based on complex and integrative models. A micro-service architecture of a distributed environment for multi-agent modeling of complex systems is proposed, which allows for deep integration into a single cyber environment of a post-industrial society.

67|7917000|Conference Paper|2016|Yoshinobu Kawabe|On Computer-Assisted Verification of Timed Anonymity of Multi-Agent Systems|A multi-agent system is called anonymous if an adversary who can observe all the occurrences of events from the system cannot determine who is the &#034;actor agent&#034; of the events. Many agent systems such as e-voting or e-cash systems should guarantee the anonymity property because in such systems agents deal with privacy information. Also, the notion of anonymity can be found in a party game called Werewolf, also known as Mafia, the game is recently employed as a research benchmark in a AI community. For analyzing the anonymity of agents, we should deal with real-time systems. In this paper we show what formulae should be proven for the timed anonymity of multi-agent systems and we conduct a computer-assisted proof with an interactive theorem proving tool.

67|5554510|Conference Paper|2010|Xin-hai Xia|Coordination based on Multi-Agent and its application of urban intersection traffic coordination control|Coordination based on Multi-Agent constitutes a focus of open, distributed, complicated systems. In this paper,this technique is applied to urban intersection traffic coordination control. The design employs an Agent controller for each signalized intersection that coordinates with neighboring Agents. The coordination mechanism of traffic signal control Agent is analyzed. The abstract dynamic model of coordinated distribution of resources about interactive intersections is put forward used traffic signal control Agent as a role. Two-person game is applied to realize the coordination which lets Agents learn how to cooperate and try to balance between their local and global goals. In the approach proposed, the learning rule assigns greater significance to recent than to past payoff information. To achieve this, a memory factor is used in order to avoid the complete neglect of the payoff obtained by one action in the past. By comparing the method with and without the coordination by an experiment of multi- intersections, the result indicates that the coordination method based on Multi-Agent is effective.
67|6661783|Conference Paper|2013|Farid Mokhati|A novel conformance testing technique for Agent Interaction Protocols|Agent Interaction Protocols (AIP) play a crucial role in multi-agent systems development. AIP allow specifying interactions (sequences of messages) between agents. As agent-oriented development emerges, testing agent-based software is receiving increased research attention. We present, in this paper, a novel conformance testing technique for agent interaction protocols. The approach supports an incremental testing strategy that considers both agent and society testing of Multi-Agent Systems. It uses aspect-oriented technology to support and monitor the testing process. The proposed technique consists in two main phases: (1) Generating adequate test cases from a formal description of Multi-Agent Systems'; behavior, and (2) Verifying the execution of test cases. The technique is supported by a visual tool (AIPTE: Agent Interaction Protocols Testing Environment). A case study is presented to illustrate the approach.
67|6060763|Conference Paper|2011|Naotsuna Fujimori|Passivity-based hierarchical consensus for nonlinear multi-agent systems|This paper is concerned with hierarchical consensus for a group of agents with nonlinear passive dynamics. Our main idea of achieving consensus is to design the upper level interconnection so that passivity of subsystems is guaranteed by choosing the I/O of subsystems appropriately. We show that consensus can be achieved if the interconnection graph is strongly connected by constructing a Lyapnov function in the form of a weighted sum of storage functions for the subsystems. The result can be extended to an adaptive case for a class of unknown nonlinear systems.
67|8088320|Conference Paper|2017|Michael Scholz|Software-in-the-loop testbed for multi-agent-systems in a discrete event simulation: Integration of the Java Agent Development Framework into Plant Simulation|Today';s research projects propose a modular manufacturing environment for production sites, which adapt itself autonomously and makes manufacturing decisions without human interaction. Therefore, it is necessary that the next generations of production lines, especially the intralogistics transportation systems, are designed more adaptable and flexible. The object in this paper is a cyber-physical material flow system with flexible, autonomous and collaborative vehicles combined with centralized sensors to digitize the workspace. For this purpose, an interface was developed which allows a discrete event simulation tool to communicate with a Multi-Agent-System. Thereby, the decision-making of the agents is integrated directly into the simulation process of the discrete event simulation software. The architecture of this interface is presented as well as a test of its functionality. The architecture is implemented with the Java Agent Development Framework and Plant Simulation as the discrete event simulation tool. The result is an interface, which allows to transfer data from the simulation, in case of an event, to the agent platform. The Multi-Agent-System solves the event specific problem due to its ontology and responses it to the simulation. Therefore, it is possible to integrate the ontology implemented in the physical system as software-in-the-loop in the simulation environment. Furthermore, the possibility is given to improve the ontology iteratively based on historical production data. Different strategies of agents can be combined and improved through machine-learning algorithms by using real production data from the task specific hardware. This leads into a continuous improvement process.
67|7361245|Conference Paper|2015|Mahmoud Mezghani|WSN intelligent communication based on Khalimsky theory using multi-agent systems|In this paper, we proposed a new approach of data routing in wireless sensors network (WSN) based on Khalimsky theory and Multi-agent systems (MAS). The WSN is constituted by a set of nodes grouped into clusters, and another set of deployed nodes according to the Khalimsky topology acting as gateway agents (GA). In each cluster, there are member node agents (MNA) for data collecting and a master node agent called cluster-head node agent (CHA) for inter-cluster data aggregation, fusion and data transmission to GA. The gateways are organized according to the Khalimsky topology to transmit data by selecting an optimal path among the set of shortest paths between two sensor nodes. Our simulation study showed an optimization of the energy consumption and the communication rates by our solution using the Khalimsky theory and the multi-agent systems. The simulation results of our solution are compared with the results of other routing protocols such as conventional Flooding protocol, Khalimsky Flooding algorithm and LEACH protocol.

67|9311227|Journal Article|2021|Fengyi Yuan|Adaptive NN Control for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems With Unknown Control Direction and Full State Constraints|This paper proposes an adaptive full state constrained consensus control strategy for a class of non-affine multi-agent systems with partially unknown control directions. Such non-affine systems commonly appear in practical applications and are difficult to control, especially with unknown control directions. Neural network is an excellent approximation tool to solve unknown parameters in the aforementioned consensus systems. The method of one-to-one mapping and mean value theorem can eliminate coupling terms and guarantee that the states of each agent are not violated the predetermined time-varying dynamic constraint boundary. In this way, the original systems can be transformed into an equivalent unconstrained systems, and the transformed systems obtained has the same consensus with the original systems. Considering that directions of control are partially unknown, the Nussbaum function can solve this problem in a novel way. Then the stability of the systems can be proved by Lyapunov function and all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. In the end, the simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

67|9214269|Conference Paper|2020|V C Jishnu Sankar|Multi Agent Based Load Management System For Smart Distribution Grid|Using multi agent systems, a scheme is developed in this research work for adjusting loads to the generation. While considering the power systems with large renewable generation integration, there is a chance of mismatch in load demand and generation due to climatic factors and hence it results in the frequency regulation issues and stability challenges. Thus there is a need to reduce the load demand to match the generation. In this paper, a demand response algorithm is developed, where the feeders can adjust its load to the generation by switching off the non-critical loads in houses under it by means of the agent based communication and thus the need for centralized control is eliminated. The simulations are performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK and verified the proposed algorithm.

67|823187|Conference Paper|1999|H. Katagiri|Dynamics of multi-agent systems by RasID learning|Presents a model and learning method for controlling multi-agent systems that are composed of plural agents. Generally speaking multi-agent systems are recognized as the systems where the group behavior of many autonomous subjects or individuals is different from the one obtained by just accumulating the behavior of each agent. In the paper, the dynamic of each agent is described by the equation including parameters for controlling the interaction of each agent, and these parameters are trained to meet the specification of the multi-agent dynamics. The dynamics of the agents can be represented by the distance between the agents and the following or dispersal parameters that express the interaction among the agents. These parameters are calculated by fuzzy inference whose antecedent part is the function of the distance between the agents. By training means and variances of the membership function of the antecedent part and consequent part, we can obtain the required dynamics of the agents. The criterion of this learning is a maximum Lyapunov exponent because of it';s suitability for describing stable or chaotic movements.

Then we present an explicit expression of the time-varying formation reference function. Finally, we use numerical simulation to verify the validity of the theoretical results.

68|6345467|Conference Paper|2012|Arangamanikkannan Manickam|An novel approach for the design of Bus Management Agent Clusters for power system control and protection|In this paper, we propose a multi-agent methodology (MAM) for power system monitoring and protection. The uniqueness of the proposed architecture is the ability of MAM to evolve in the wake of an attack of malicious intent by mutation and thus always monitoring a power system bus remotely. Also, the architecture interacts with the mutated agents using a voting methodology thus alleviating the effect of agent malfunction in the presence of an attack. This architecture also enables interagent communication which makes a collaborative framework and increases the degree of fault tolerance. This architecture is tested on a two-area, five-machine, and 8 bus power network for abnormal condition detection, generator bus isolation, and also for restoring power to the area which is affected by the bus isolation. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed methodology is capable of not only detecting the power grid attack but it can also continuously monitor and isolate the generator bus even in the presence of sustained attack as the agents are regenerated.

A HMS can be modeled as a cooperative multi-agent system with constraints of production processes and finite resources. Deadlocks may also take place in HMS. Although there are many works on HMS, there is still lack of research known to the author addressing the issue of deadlock in HMS. This paper focuses on the modeling of HMS and development of deadlock free task distribution and resource allocation protocol and algorithm based on the framework of multi-agent systems. Our results include: (1) a mathematical multi-agent model for the HMS; (2) characterization of deadlock free conditions for task distribution and resource allocation; (3) a collaboration network formation process for coordination and negotiation among agents; and (4) a class of deadlock free task distribution and resource allocation algorithms based on deadlock free conditions.
68|8200129|Journal Article|2013|Natalia Criado|THOMAS: An agent platform for supporting normative multi-agent systems|Open Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are formed by autonomous and heterogeneous agents that may pursue different and even conflicting goals. Therefore, no assumption can be a priori made about their behaviours. Thus, it is needed to constrain the potential excesses of agent autonomous behaviour by means of regulation of agent interaction. Because of this, ‚Äòsocial‚Äô notions, such as organizations, institutions and norms, have been introduced in the MAS research as coordination and cooperation mechanisms. However, there is still a need to define frameworks which take these organizational abstractions into account. With this aim, this work describes a model of norms for agent organizations that covers both institutional and interaction levels, as well as different types of norms (i.e. constitutive, regulative and procedural norms). This model of norms has been implemented in a specific multi-agent platform, named THOMAS (Methods, Techniques and Tools for Open Multi-Agent Systems), which provides a suitable framework for the management of agent organizations.

This paper further presents a study of MeMAS in developing human-like non-player characters in complex first-person shooter (FPS) games. In particular, we consider a well-known commercial FPS game, known as Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004), as our game of interest and discuss the details of non-player characters based on a manifestation of ‚ÄúTemporal Difference - Fusion Architecture for Learning and Cognition‚Äù (TDFALCON) neural network. In addition, we present a brief cross-domain study of MeMAS wherein the useful knowledge in the form of memes learned from different yet related simple domains previously solved are used to enhance learning performance of the non-player characters in UT2004. Benchmark experiments are studied to investigate the efficacy of MeMAS in UT2004 from various aspects, including learning efficiency, generalization capability, and computational cost. The empirically results indicate that the MeMAS could clearly improve the learning effectiveness and efficiency of designed non-player characters in UT2004.

68|7579601|Journal Article|2017|Lifeng Ma|Event-Triggered Mean-Square Consensus Control for Time-Varying Stochastic Multi-Agent System With Sensor Saturations|In this technical note, the consensus control problem is investigated for a class of discrete time-varying stochastic multi-agent system subject to sensor saturations. An event-based mechanism is adopted where each agent updates the control input signal only when the pre-specified triggering condition is violated. To reflect the time-varying manner and characterize the transient consensus behavior, a new index for mean-square consensus is put forward to quantify the deviation level from individual agent to the average value of all agents'; states. For a fixed network topology, the aim of the proposed problem is to design time-varying output-feedback controllers such that, at each time step, the mean-square consensus index of the closed-loop multi-agent system satisfies the pre-specified upper bound constraints subject to certain triggering mechanism. Both the existence conditions and the explicit expression of the desired controllers are established by resorting to the solutions to a set of recursive matrix inequalities. An illustrative simulation example is utilized to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms.

By solving the average consensus problem of those abstractions, the control protocol for physical agents were synthesized in a hierarchical way. An example was given to show its effectiveness.

An augmented system is constructed where the augmented state vector contains system states and sensor faults, and assumptions on the fault are not necessary. By using the information of adjacent agents, an unknown input observer (UIO) for the ith agent can be designed to decouple the disturbances as much as possible and attenuate the influence from the disturbances that cannot be decoupled. The desired parameters of the UIO can be derived via solving recursive linear matrix inequalities over a finite horizon. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

68|7535233|Conference Paper|2016|Aaron Roggow|Autonomous identification of local agents in multi-agent robotic swarms|With the emergence of swarm intelligence and evolutionary algorithms, system designers are creating robotic swarms of continuously increasing sizes. As the size of a swarm increases, it is imperative to have a uniform program collectively downloaded on all the agents in it. These uniform programs impede the designer';s ability to designate distinct identities for various agents in the swarm. In this work we propose an algorithm that, when implemented in a robotic swarm, allows the locally interacting agents to autonomously designate unique identifications to each other at run time. The results show that when used on a small swarm of autonomous robots, running the algorithm led to a steady state where every agent in a local neighborhood was assigned a unique identification value.

They';re designed to operate in a dynamically changing environment. MASs offer new features such as autonomy, pro-activity, communication, cooperation, and negotiation, which can help cloud computing platforms to offer solutions that aren';t available in current cloud infrastructures. Our main motivation to integrating MASs is their ability to make clouds smarter in their interactions. This paper introduces a Trusted third party (TTP) based on Multi-agent systems in order to control the quality of service contract and guarantee transparency and symmetry with respect to the SLA contract between prospective signatories. This TTP will use MASs to apply an advanced penalty model that guarantees the performance and the reliability of the Cloud.

These systems tend to select the best solution for their problems. They can be used in different tasks which are hard for an individual or even a complex system to do. One of the most common algorithms which are used in multi agent systems is flocking. Here we introduce a theorem that multi agent systems could flock in environments with fixed obstacles without any collision between agents and obstacles. We use Lyapunov theory and prior algorithms on flocking to extract a theorem which under those conditions in the theorem, collision never occurs between agents and obstacles. Results show that the theorem insures collision avoidance between agents and obstacles.

 consensus control for the multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances is investigated via dynamic output feedback (DOF) strategy. Both the control input and the measured output are sampled. By employing the input/output delay approach, the multi-agent system with sampled-data DOF control protocol is transformed into the closed-loop system with bounded time-varying delays. Then, by using matrix theory, graph theory, Lyapunov stability theory, and some decoupling methods, sufficient conditions for the sampled-data L

Using the reciprocally convex approach, a sufficient condition for consensus is derived in terms of matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result.
69|1360054|Journal Article|2004|D.P. Buse|Mobile agents for remote control of distributed systems|A modern distributed industrial system, such as a power transmission system, consists of many sites distributed throughout a wide area. Each site contains a number of monitoring and control devices, also known as intelligent electronic devices, which perform various tasks including condition monitoring, control, and protection. However, apart from dedicated links to the control center for control purposes, substations are often connected by networks with relatively low bandwidth, which makes remote access to these devices for control or monitoring relatively difficult. Therefore, we propose the use of mobile agents for remote access to devices. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of the use of mobile agents are evaluated by means of a theoretical model and a series of experiments. The results suggest that for networks with high latency mobile agents may provide performance improvements over more conventional client-server systems.

Having autonomous agents capable of learning its previously unknown teammates'; preferences and acting in harmony with them to achieve the system';s end has been declared as a challenge to the AI. An agent capable of ad hoc teamwork is one that can effectively cooperate with multiple potential teammates on a set of collaborative tasks. This agent has to learn other agents'; behaviours and preferences in order to be able to predict their actions on some level. This paper presents an empirical study of ad hoc teamwork, taking advantage of Observer System';s merits. Specifically, we evaluate a learning mechanism for on-line behaviour generation on the part of a single ad hoc team agent that must collaborate with other unknown teammates in the pursuit domain.

First, a polynomial fuzzy model is established to describe the error nonlinear multi-agent system that is formed by one virtual leader and followers. Then, a new event-triggering transmission strategy is proposed to mitigate communication and computational load. By utilizing the event-triggering mechanism and modeling the switching topologies by semi-Markov process, an event-triggering consensus protocol based on sampled data is designed. Compared with traditional Markov jump topologies, the transition rate is time-varying for semi-Markov switching topologies. By mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the sum of square based relaxed stabilization conditions for fuzzy MASs under semi-Markov jump topologies are obtained to guarantee event-triggering consensus in an even-square sense. An illustrative example is provided to verify the proposed consensus design schemes.

69|6775603|Conference Paper|2013|Ramesh Rajesh|Multi-agent system framework for rural Indian microgrids|This paper presents a design framework of multi-agent systems (MAS) for the typical rural Indian microgrid. The agents are responsible for the acquisition and computation of emergent data arising from the interaction of the various agent entities within the microgrid. Individual agents and their functions are mapped with operations that are custom-framed for the rural Indian microgrid scenario. The framework developed for the modeling of a single microgrid MAS allows for effective control and better operation. The agents designed in this microgrid typically fall into one of the three broad categories of DG agents, Mu agents and D agents. In the rural Indian context, the Load agent, the Grid Agent, the DER agent and the Storage agent are typically DG agents. The Communication agent is the Mu agent and the Control agent is the D agent. The design philosophy has been proposed keeping in mind that the Indian rural microgrid has renewable sources (namely solar, wind, and biogas), storage, and intermittent grid supply as energy sources.

69|9345395|Early Access Article|2021|Qishao Wang|An Accelerated Algorithm for Linear Quadratic Optimal Consensus of Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems|An accelerated algorithm is proposed in this paper for solving the linear quadratic optimal consensus problem of multi-agent systems. To optimize the linear quadratic response and the final consensus state simultaneously, a nonseparable multi-objective optimization problem with coupled constraints on decision variables is formulated. The main difficulty in solving the optimization problem lies in the nonlinear coupling of objectives, which is overcome by separating the problem into two independent and solvable single-objective optimization subproblems using the alternating direction method of multipliers. The proximal gradient decent scheme is then introduced to approximate the precise optimal solutions of the subproblems so as to improve the computing efficiency. Convergence analysis is performed to estimate the convergence rate and derive the convergence condition, which is independent of any global information of the system and therefore is fully distributed. Furthermore, the solution of each subproblem is obtained in a distributed form, allowing the multi-agent system to achieve optimal consensus. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the accelerated algorithm.
69|5689164|Conference Paper|2010|Xiao-long Xu|The model and the security mechanism of the information retrieval system based on mobile multi-agent|Traditional information retrieval systems have several shortcomings in common, such as delaying in information updating, costing additional host and network resources, and so on. The promise of mobile multi-agent technology is becoming highly attractive. We approach to apply the mobile multi-agent technology to information retrieval in order to build a brand-new system. Although the mobile multi-agent technology advantages information retrieval systems, it also brings several new negative problems. The most serious one is the security problem because of agent';s mobility and initiative. In this paper, we firstly analyze the drawbacks of current information retrieval systems, and then describe how to employ the mobile multi-agent technology to the information retrieval system to improve its performance. What we discuss mainly in this paper is the security problems of the information retrieval system based on mobile multi-agent (IRSMMA). We analyze threats to the security of the new system, study out the security policies, and at last establish a robust and secure architecture name MMASA (Mobile Multi-Agent Security Architecture), which can effectively protect our system, and also adapt to other network application based on mobile multi-agent because of its generality.

It is assumed that the multi-agent system works in a noisy environment (state noises, measurement noises and communication noises). A dynamic output-feedback based protocol is proposed to solve the stochastic output consensus problem in this setting. It is proved that the mathematical expectations of relative outputs between agents are convergent to zero, and the second-order moments of relative outputs between agents are uniformly bounded. Finally, some simulation examples are presented to demonstrate this phenomenon.

The paper proposes a best response learning based on Gaussian regression for multi-agent systems in continuous spaces. With a new Q value with reduced dimension defined, the algorithm entitles agent to learning strategy adapting to others'; behaviors. To realize generalization, probabilistic model of state transition in the algorithm is constructed by using Gaussian regression, so that dynamic programming can be applied directly to generate the best response strategy. And both Q-function model and V-function model are built real time in order to generalize state and action spaces. Thus the learning agent is able to tracking partners'; strategies. In the simulation of Double-cart-pole, which is a typical coordinated control problem, even if dynamics is unknown in priori, the algorithm enables agent to learn coordinated strategy, and realize generalization of state space as well.
69|6393397|Conference Paper|2012|Jaeyong Kim|Practical consensus for heterogeneous linear time-varying multi-agent systems|This paper studies practical consensus (PC) problem for linear multi-agent systems (MAS) under a fixed, connected, and undirected communication network. PC means that the difference between any two agents remains in an arbitrarily chosen neighborhood of the origin after some time by using a suitable control law. All the agents, which are heterogeneous first-order linear time-varying (LTV) systems, can collect only relative state information from their neighborhoods. According to the assumptions of MAS, we divide the problem into two cases; one is a class of homogeneous LTV MAS with heterogeneous disturbances where the difference between any two disturbances is bounded, and the other is a class of heterogeneous LTV MAS with heterogeneous bounded disturbances. Finally, we show that PC for each case is always achieved if the control gain is sufficiently large.
69|7470802|Conference Paper|2016|Farid El Hajj|Multi-agent system vulnerability detector for a secured E-learning environment|Information and communication systems have several security vulnerabilities. In addition, conventional security software requires tuning effort and may not be able to detect many web attacks. For this reasons, security becomes a worldwide objective to many technological systems including Learning Management Systems (LMSs) such as Moodle. In this work, we propose a secured multi agent system (MAS) with an interceptor IIS module (IIISM) which denies malicious user access by adding a security layer to any web application including the LMS Moodle environment. The IIISM extends the IIS Server and listens to any http request targeting the web application and the LMS Moodle. While, the analysis and the design of the MAS architecture are based on the Gaia methodology, the agents were implemented using the JADE agents'; middleware. This security layer overcomes the hacker attack based on the SQL injection and the cross site scripting for Moodle environment. In a first scenario, a student is requesting a course, the MAS validate this request, and the web page is displayed normally. A second scenario presents the URL and form based for the SQL injection attack by a hacker. The MAS agents detect the attack and and they respond by a denial of access to this malicious user. Moreover, this proposed security layer can be easily extended to include other security detection modules which correspond to common web vulnerabilities.
69|1507050|Conference Paper|2005|R. Montanari|Context-based security management for multi-agent systems|Policies are being increasingly used for controlling the behavior of complex multi-agent systems. The use of policies allows administrators to specify both agent permissions and duties without changing source code or requiring the consent or cooperation of the agents being governed. However, policy-based control can encounter difficulties when applied to agents that act in pervasive environments characterized by frequent and unpredictable changes. In this case, policies cannot be all specified a priori to face any operative run time situation, but require continuous adjustments to allow agents to behave in a contextually appropriate manner. Current approaches to policy representation have been restrictive in many ways, as they typically follow a subject-centric model, which assigns agent permissions and obligations on the basis of agent role/identity information. However, in the new pervasive scenario the roles/identities of interacting agents may not be known a-priori and most important, may not be informative or sufficiently trustworthy. We claim that the design of policy-based agent systems for pervasive environments requires a paradigm shift from subject-centric to context-centric policy models. This paper discusses some issues concerning the specification and enforcement of context-driven policies and presents a novel context-based policy approach that considers context as a first-class principle to guide both policy specification and enforcement. In this perspective, &#034;context&#034; explicitly appears in the specification of security policies and context changes trigger the evaluation process of applicable agent permissions and obligations.

Consequently, the requirements for appropriate or optimal decisions and successfully completed activities are hard to meet. Given that expected future events and circumstances often occur in nonlinear mechanisms, the decisions made by following the models of traditional predicting and planning are not satisfactory. This calls for new approaches to decision making and acting. The decision making situation in the group of actors can be illustrated using different formal Methods. Thus, we analyzed multi-agent system and dynamic decision making mechanism, and presented learning wheel in decision making. These research results can be used to describe the nonlinear mechanisms in multi-agent decision making system.

Distributed event-based protocols, consisting of the event-based control laws and the triggering functions, are designed, under which the consensus error is asymptotically stable and the Zeno behavior can be excluded. Compared to the previous related works, our main contribution is that we propose a fully distributed adaptive event-triggered consensus protocol, independent of the network';s scale and relying on none global information of the network graph. Based on the event-triggered strategy, continuous communications are not required for either control laws updating or triggering functions monitoring. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

70|9393388|Journal Article|2021|Janghoon Yang|A Consensus Control for a Multi-Agent System With Unknown Time-Varying Communication Delays|A multi-agent system to have information flow among agents is bound to experience a communication delay over a directed graph. However, delay information is often unavailable and time varying. To deal with this problem, a consensus control for a second-order multi-agent system consisting of a leader and multiple followers is developed. Sliding mode control is exploited to deal with uncertainties incurred by unknown time varying communication delay and disturbance. The proposed sliding mode consensus control is shown to achieve the asymptotic bounded consensus and the finite time convergence of a sliding variable for any unknown time varying delay with the bounded first and the second derivative. The numerical simulations verify the properties of the proposed algorithm and its performance which is almost identical to one achieved by a consensus algorithm exploiting known delay information.

In order to implement the integration, the hierarchy cooperation model in this paper is implemented with horizontal cooperation model combined with vertical one. In the horizontal cooperation model, centralized control agent in this model executes scripts to control the cooperation among agents. It can improve the flexibility of the systems integration. While in the vertical cooperation model, an extension of the contract net protocol using conversational method, named CECNP (the conversational extended contract net protocol) is introduced, which can improve the intelligence of the systems integration. The hierarchy cooperation model is applied to the agent-based systems integration tool (ASIT), and it takes the border and coast defense simulation system (BCDSS) as a test case. The various modules of BCDSS have been integrated successfully and the validity of this model has been proved in ASIT.

Schmidt|Multi-agent speed consensus via delayed position feedback with application to Kuramoto oscillators|We present conditions for a nonlinear single integrator multi-agent system to achieve a consensus on the derivatives of the agents'; states, e.g. their speed, by comparing the state information, e.g. their position. This consensus property is even more surprising because the states themselves do not necessarily reach a consensus. We prove that consensus is reached even if the communication network between the agents introduces communication delays. As a special case, the considered model includes delay coupled Kuramoto oscillators with nonidentical natural frequencies. We apply our result to these oscillators and show that frequency entrainment is guaranteed for appropriate initial conditions.

The agent dynamics are MIMO in lower triangular form and uncertain, as all nonlinearities are unknown and moreover they are perturbed by external additive disturbances. Further, no knowledge is provided regarding bounds or functions bounding the actual system nonlinearities. In addition, the dynamic orders of all agents may not be the same. Each agent utilizes only relative output information from its neighbors and its own state. The underlying communication graph is directed. The proposed control protocol is distributed and of low analytic and computational complexity; thus facilitating implementation. Simulation studies clarify the approach and highlight the theoretical findings.
70|8243131|Conference Paper|2017|Hongjie Ni|Output feedback control of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with stochastic sampled-data|The importance of static output feedback (OPFB) design for aircraft control, process control, and elsewhere has been well documented since the 1960s, since full state measurements are not usually available in practical systems. This problem is compounded in the case of multi-agent systems (MASs) where each agent has its own state variable and measured outputs. Therefore, this paper will focus on OPFB control for discrete-time heterogeneous MASs with aperiodic sampled-date and propose a class of distributed communication protocols based on output regulation equations. More specifically, the sampling process is stochastic and it is modelled by a Markovian chain. With the aid of Markovian jump system method and Lyapunov stability theory, the OPFB control under stochastic sampling is shown to be solvable if some linear matrix inequalities are satisfied. Meanwhile, the control protocol design algorithm is designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a simulation experiment is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level multi-stage agent-based modeling framework that automates the decision-making processes during crowd evacuation in large-scale facilities. We demonstrate that crowd behaviors can be modeled at different stages and at several layers. We do this by integrating a probabilistic model with a dynamic generating process of intelligent guide agents to automatically generate decisions that are nearly optimal for neighboring agents. Specifically, we apply the framework to different evacuation scenarios and analyze its effectiveness in case of a high-density crowd. Our experimental results provide evidence that the hybrid multi-layered approach can be successfully applied to efficiently simulate agent behaviors in intensive crowd environments. The results show that employing our method, which is scalable, outperforms the standard conservative agent-based approaches.
70|6394440|Conference Paper|2012|Zhang Ran|A Model of Collaborative Intrusion Detection System Based on Multi-agents|With the rapid development of computer network and applications, attacks are becoming more and more complicated and elusive. The traditional intrusion detection systems have been unable to meet new security requirements. This paper proposes a collaborative intrusion detection model based on multi-agents. In this model, four kinds of agents are defined, which are organized in a hierarchical structure. The basic agents in every host or at the entrances of subnets are responsible for performing the simple detection and response tasks. The complicated collaboration task is executed by some separate coordination agents, which are responsible for synthetically analyzing the suspicious behavior that the lower-level agents are unable to identify. Coordination agents are also able to assign the task to the lower-level associated agents. Based on the hierarchical structure, the formal description of the model is given. By adaptive policies and dynamic association among some elements, this model provides dynamic adaptability to the changing environment and attacks. In addition, this paper also proposes the concept of coordination domain which facilitates the management of collaborative detection. The model lays a theoretical foundation for constructing dynamically adaptive intrusion detection system.

It builds the simulation framework and multi agent framework of the hybrid micro-grid, including AC micro-grid agent, DC micro-grid agent and distribution grid agent. Aiming at the bidirectional AC/DC converter that keeps the power balance of the AC/DC hybrid micro-grid and ensures the operation stability of the microgrid, this paper firstly builds the mathematical model of bidirectional AC/DC converter, and then investigates the control strategies in different operation modes of the bidirectional AC/DC converter. By detecting the instantaneous frequency value of AC micro-grid and the instantaneous voltage value of the DC bus, the working modes of bidirectional AC/DC converter can be decided by the strategy, which consist of rectifier mode, inverter mode and stop mode. The simulation for the proposed strategy for the example system was applied on grid-connecting and islanding modes respectively with MATLAB/Simulink. The result shows that the stability control of the hybrid micro-grid can be achieved by the proposed control strategy with the multi agent system.

The main principle of multi-agent systems lies in solving difficult problems of high complexity and cost to single agents by employing many agents that can function without a central control unit. The consensus problem, which is used in order to achieve a common decision making by utilizing communication between agents, has been studied since long ago. However, even though MAS function through wireless communication channels, the effect of fading channel models on the consensus problem, have not been yet investigated in detail. This study analyzes this effect on the linear average consensus protocol. Monte Carlo simulations have been done on fixed topologies with different agent numbers and fading channel models for increasing SNR values.

Collins|Multi-Agent System control and coordination of an electrical network|Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have the potential to solve Active Network Management (ANM) problems arising from an increase in Distributed Energy Resources (DER). The aim of this research is to integrate a MAS into an electrical network emulation for the purpose of implementing ANM. Initially an overview of agents and MAS and how their characteristics can be used to control and coordinate an electrical network is presented. An electrical network comprising a real-time emulated transmission network connected to a live DER network controlled and coordinated by a MAS is then constructed. The MAS is then used to solve a simple ANM problem: the control and coordination of an electrical network in order to maintain frequency within operational limits. The research concludes that a MAS is successful in solving this ANM problem and also that in the future the developed MAS can be applied to other ANM problems.

Distributed single and double proportional-retarded (SPR and DPR) controllers which include time delay are both considered. By using only two branches of the Lambert W function, the SPR controllers are designed and the stabilizing set of the control parameters is presented analytically for first-order multi-agent systems. In particular, the distributed SPR controllers satisfying the pole assignment index are presented for single-integrator multi-agent systems. The SPR controllers have only two adjustable parameters and may not be applicable to complex systems. Hence, for high-order multi-agent systems, the H

On the basis of triangle property, two proportional parameters (k) in the DPR controller are obtained. Moreover, the delay parameters (œÑ) in the DPR controllers are determined for the proportional parameters and then searching for the intersection of delay parameters in the resultant stabilizing region for each characteristic value of Laplacian matrix.

We will show that a 3-dimensional manifold can be constructed based on the information about all the Lipschitz constants of the multi-agent systems, such that whenever the three parameters of each PID controller are chosen from this manifold, the whole system can be stabilized globally and the tracking error of each agent approaches to zero asymptotically. A simulation example is given to illustrate the theoretical results.

The dynamics of the agents is modeled by the general continuous-time linear systems, and the interaction topology is assumed to be fixed and undirected. In a recent reference, a distributed sampled-data based consensus protocol was proposed to solve the consensus problem, and a sufficient condition is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), by which LMI-based approach was proposed to construct the feedback gain matrix. By using the similar method, a simple and low order consensus condition and the related gain matrix design approach are proposed. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the theoretical analysis.

It coordinates agents to move objects to destinations efficiently and effectively. Adaptive coordination is achieved by looking up a relationship table from which a relative best coordination algorithm can be found to perform the object-sorting tasks. An adaptive resonance theory network is utilized to cluster the object distribution so as to help construct the relationship table. By using adaptive rules for performing OST, experimental results showed that agents work more efficiently than single coordination solutions. An analysis of object distributions of OST provides a concrete result to make agents perform OST with the best performance.

It helps people complete relay setting calculation. But there are some problems in the relay protection setting calculation system. For example, it is difficult to update knowledge and can not automatically acquire new knowledge. So the intelligence of the systems is limited. This paper introduces multi-agent into the field of relay protection setting calculation system for power plant. The multi-agent system connects agents which run in different power plants and forms an intelligent system in which each agent can work independently, cooperate and share knowledge with other agents. Agents can be layered and classified through knowledge being shared and verified. After the real-time data of the plants is introduced into relay protection setting calculation system, multi-agent system can use data mining to discover new knowledge. It can greatly improve the intelligence of relay protection setting calculation system.

The communication topology of the multi-agent system that describes completely unknown nonlinear dynamics and unmeasured states is described by a directed graph. The proposed decentralized control algorithm is developed based on high-gain observer theory and fuzzy adaptive control algorithm. The high-gain observer is introduced to estimate the agents'; unmeasured states. The fuzzy logic systems are used as the approximator to deal with the nonlinear unknown dynamics. By the Lyapunov theory and consensus analysis, we can prove the consensus errors and the observer errors can be reduced as small as desired by choosing the appropriate design parameters. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by the simulation example.

As market competition intensifies, the publishing house uses such as discount, distribution catalogue of books, website of books and other methods to gain more profits. However, many questions exist in these services. The service doesn';t make clear definition; the service function overlapped; the services independently operated and rarely communicated each other; the service management confused etc. Consequently, these problems reduce the efficiency of service marketing. This paper details the processes undertaken to create an application utilizing ontology and multi-agent, for service marketing of the publishing house. Ontology aggregates the agreed knowledge about service marketing and publishing industry. The paper presents the critical issues of ontology driven multi-agent system and puts forward a solution plan. In this paper introduces the service marketing system architecture of the publishing house, relationships between agent and ontology. In addition, we describe in detail how to design and construct ontology. This approach contributes to use ontology as knowledge repository to bundle the atomic service to form specific service marketing scheme for every customer.
71|8324111|Conference Paper|2017|Zeinab Daavarani Asl|A new approach on multi-agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on agents' preferences|Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm for solving Markov Decision Process (MDP). Traditional RL algorithms aim to solve one-objective problems, but many real-world problems have more than one objective which conflict each other. In recent years, Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, which employ a reward vector instead of a scalar reward signal, have been proposed to solve multi-objective problems. In MORL, because of conflicting objectives, there is no one optimal solution and a set of solutions named Pareto Front will be learned. In this paper, we proposed a new multi-agent method, which uses a shared Q-table for all agents to solve bi-objective problems. However, each agent selects actions based on its preference. These preferences are different with each other and the agents reach to Pareto Front solutions based on this preferences. The proposed method is simple in understanding and its computational cost is very low. Moreover, after finding the Pareto Front set, we can easily track the policy. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the available methods in the term of learning speed.

The agent subsystems are connected by lossy channels, which can be described by Markov process. The relationship of agent dynamics, communication network, and packet losses rate is studied, and based on which the MASs can achieve consensus by a designed distributed controller. Specifically, based on the stability of a transformed system state function under the identical packet looses, we first derive the sufficient condition of consensus for discrete-time MASs, and meanwhile design the control gain. Then, we also discuss the sufficient condition of consensus for the MASs under nonidentical packet losses. At last, the availability of the proposed results is illustrated through simulation examples.

The output and input control signals of the systems are quantized by sector-bounded quantizer. A disturbance observer and a fuzzy state observer are simultaneously designed to estimate unknown external disturbances and unmeasured states, respectively.

Finally, a practical simulation example is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

71|7004542|Journal Article|2014|Huiyang Liu|Containment control of general linear multi-agent systems with multiple dynamic leaders: A fast sliding mode based approach|In this paper, distributed containment control problems of general linear multi-agent systems are investigated. The objective is to make the followers in a multi-agent network converge to the convex hull spanned by some leaders whose control inputs are nonzero and not available to any followers. Sliding mode surfaces are defined for the cases of reduced order and non-reduced order, respectively. For each case, fast sliding mode controllers are designed. It is shown that all the error trajectories exponentially reach the sliding mode surfaces in a finite time if for each follower, there exists at least one of the leaders who has a directed path to the follower, and the leaders'; control inputs are bounded. The control Lyapunov function for exponential finite time stability, motivated by the fast terminal sliding mode control, is used to prove reachability of the sliding mode surfaces. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

It is assumed in this problem that measurement output is only available at sampling instants, and the value of the control input only updates at those sampling instants. To solve this problem, a sampled-data output feedback control based on distributed continuous-discrete observer is proposed. This new algorithm has the performance that the sampling period can be freely chosen. We then show the asymptotic stability of the equivalent discrete-time system transformed from sampled-data closed-loop system.

71|8329151|Journal Article|2018|Qi Wang|Fully Distributed Fault-Tolerant Consensus Protocols for Lipschitz Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems|In this paper, we investigate the fault-tolerant consensus problems for multi-agent systems with actuator faults. Based on the relative state information, fully distributed adaptive protocols are designed for these agents described by Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics under leaderless and leader-follower communication structures. As the special case, for linear multi-agent systems, fault-tolerant consensus problems are also solved with the proposed protocols. First, for the leaderless multi-agent systems, all agents reach an agreement on a common value with undirected connected communication graphs. Second, for the leader-follower multi-agent systems, in which the state of the leader is only available to a subset of the followers, the state of each follower converges to the state of the leader, asymptotically. A distinctive feature of this paper is that the adaptive protocols here are independent of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with the whole communication graph, which means the protocols can be implemented by each agent in a fully distributed fashion. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

Miralaei|Category-based similarity algorithm for semantic similarity in multi-agent information sharing systems|Similarity measures are mechanisms that assign a numeric score indicating how closely two documents, or a document and a query match. Most similarity measures such as cosine measure, which treat a document as a vector of weighted keywords, consider exact matching of keywords when determining the similarity among documents and they do not consider the semantic similarity among the keywords of the documents. This paper presents a category-based similarity algorithm (CSA) to determine the semantic similarity between any two pieces of information. CSA is implemented inside the ACORN (agent-based community oriented routing network) system, which is a multi-agent system for information retrieval and provision in a community of users. CSA can also be used in any information sharing system in which the information content is represented as vectors of weighted keywords.
71|8122839|Conference Paper|2017|Chi Wang|Decentralized reinforcement social learning based on cooperative policy exploration in multi-agent systems|Coordination problems including miscoordination and relative overgeneralization are difficult to overcome especially in dynamic and stochastic environments. In the practical scenario, there may be a large number of agents, and the interactions between agents may be sparse and unfixed. In this paper, we study the coordination problems and stochastic rewards under the social learning framework where there are a group of agents and each agent behaves independently and interacts with another agent randomly chosen from the group. We are looking for a learning technique that makes all agents learn a consistent optimal policy in a two agents game with pathology of coordination problems or stochastic rewards under such a framework. A new algorithm named Decentralized concurrent learning and cooperative policy exploration (DCL-CPE) is contributed, which possesses the ability to overcome the coordination problems and the stochastic rewards via local interaction under the social learning framework. Empirical results for several cooperative games are presented to show the superiority of our algorithm.
72|8476556|Journal Article|2018|Ting Wang|Average Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems Under Directed Topologies and Binary-Valued Communications|This paper is concerned with the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems with binary-valued communications under directed topologies. The information that each agent communicates with others is binary-valued with a fixed threshold and the control is a quantity of transportation from one agent to another, which causes that a decrease of the transmitter';s state leads to an increase of the same amount of the receiver';s. Due to the limitation of the information obtained, each agent needs to wait for a period of time to collect enough binary-valued information to estimate. Hence, we construct a two-scale control algorithm. At the small-time scale, each agent estimates its neighbors'; states based on the accumulation of binary-valued information for a period of time, during which the control is zero. At the large-time scale, each agent designs the control signal based on the estimation, which results in state updating of the multi-agent system. Then, each agent estimates the new states of its neighbors and the process of alternating estimation and control will be repeated. Finally, we prove that the estimation is convergent and give the mean square convergence rate as the reciprocal of the estimation time. More importantly, the multi-agent system is proved to achieve average consensus and the consensus speed is given. Simulation results are given to validate the algorithm.
72|7804895|Conference Paper|2016|Dong Wang|An optimal algorithm for high-order multi-agent systems with event-triggered communication|The paper mainly talks about the distributed optimal issue under the continuous-time high-order multi-agent system with event-triggered communication. Every agent possesses its local convex cost function only known by itself. and our aim is to minimize the sum of all the local cost functions and make the agents convergent to the optimal point through the communication between the agents. Utilizing the knowledge of convex analysis and graph theory, we propose a distributed protocol with event-triggered communication under a undirected graph for the high-order multi-agent system. Through Lyapunov method, the agents gradually converging to the optimal point is testified. In addition, we provide an example to validate the proposed protocol.
72|8880592|Journal Article|2019|Guoqing Liu|Adaptive Finite-Time Consensus Tracking for Nonstrict Feedback Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems With Unknown Control Directions|This paper investigates the finite-time consensus tracking problem for nonstrict feedback nonlinear multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics and control directions. Firstly, the backstepping scheme based on command filter and fractional power control law is proposed, which can not only solve the problem of computational explosion, but also ensure that the state of each agent can follow the leader';s output within a finite time. Then, the error compensation signals are designed to compensate the error caused by filtering. The unknown nonlinear dynamics are approximated by the fuzzy logic system. The state variables problem in the non-strict feedback system is well solved through the scaling of inequalities. By introducing the Nussbaum function, the intermediate input signal and control input signal based on adaptive control law are designed respectively, and the problem of unknown control directions is solved. Simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the presented method.
72|9171119|Conference Paper|2020|Saranya S Nair|Event-Triggered Control for Multi-Agent Systems using Consensus Protocol|Multi-agent systems (MAS) refers to a system that is made of systems. This group of systems promises to be more efficient than single individual systems in terms of reliability and capabilities. This paper suggests, by event activated control approach the consensus problem of a distributed multi-agent network consisting of single integrator dynamics. The event condition and the consensus protocol are developed based on only local information. The event-activating conditions are only checked periodically to decide whether to refresh the information states of the agents or not. The event condition is obtained by conducting convergence analysis based on Lyapunov method. Simulation results are illustrated to show the correctness and realizability of the suggested consensus protocol.

Megherbi|An intelligent multi-agent distributed battlefield via Multi-Token Message Passing|The main focus of this paper is on issues related to communications, load balancing, resource sharing and allocation in a distributed computing system, as applied to battlefield simulation. We present a distributed architecture of a middleware and algorithms for communications, scheduling and load balancing. In the proposed distributed architecture the nodes use the Multi-Token Message Passing Interface (MPI) over the message based Myrinet communication system, namely the GM protocol, on a Gigabit Myrinet switch to communicate with each other. As we show here this brings in additional implementation challenges regarding (a) the safe usage of threads and MPI, (b) expanding MPI to support additional data-types specific to the sought battlefield simulation applications, and (3) modifying MPI to achieve equal distribution of load among nodes. The main task in load balancing is to keep load equally distributed among the computing nodes, and yet keep the notion of geographically distributed agents transparent. An additional challenge is posed by the fact that when the application is running, load balancing has to be continuously adapted- i.e. no run-time stopping is allowed to redistribute the load among nodes.
72|6896787|Conference Paper|2014|Yu Zhao|Finite-time consensus tracking for multi-agent systems with settling time estimation|This paper investigates the distributed finite-time consensus tracking problem for a group of autonomous agents modeled by double-integrator dynamics under a leader with non-zero acceleration. First of all, a distributed finite-time consensus tracking protocol is proposed based on the relative position and relative velocity measurements. By using a Lyapunov function, it is shown that distributed consensus tracking can be achieved in finite time under the condition that the acceleration of the leader is bounded but not available to followers. In particular, the settling time can be estimated efficiently by computing the value of the Lyapunov function at the initial point. Then, a new observer-based algorithm is designed to solve the finite-time consensus tracking problem when the relative velocity measurements are not available to the agents. It is proved that the states of the followers can move to that of the leader in finite time if the network topology is undirected among the followers but has a directed path from the leader to each follower. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is illustrated by numerical simulations.

The agents are tested, developed targeted toward Spanish natural language documents, which requires adapted NLP techniques.

Some sufficient conditions are presented to reach the consensus of linear multi-agent systems by using algebraic graph theory, Lyapunov stability analysis and Krasovskii solution. Meanwhile, it is also pointed out that when the agents obtain time delayed information, the given system can also reach consensus under some conditions. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.

In multi-agents systems, each agent must behave independently according to its states and environments, and, if necessary, must cooperate with other agents in order to perform a given task. In the present study, we focused on the problem of ldquotrash collectionrdquo, in which multiple agents collect all trash as quickly as possible. The goal is for multiple agents to learn to accomplish a task by interacting with the environment and acquiring cooperative behavior rules. Therefore, for a multi-agent system, we discuss how to acquire the rules of cooperative action to solve problems effectively. We construct the learning agent using the Q-learning which is a representative technique of reinforcement learning. Regarding the perceived environment of agent, two representation methods are used. We then observe how the autonomous agents obtain their action rules and examined the influence of the learning situations on the system. Moreover, we discuss how the system was influenced by learning situation and the view information of the agent.

First, to fulfill multiple formation tasks, a group of agents are decomposed into M distinct and nonoverlapping clusters. The agents in each cluster are then driven to achieve a desired formation, whereas the MAS as a whole accomplishes M cluster formations. Second, by a proper modeling of aperiodic sampling and communication delays, an aperiodic sampled-data cluster formation protocol (CFP) is delicately constructed such that the information exchanges among neighboring agents only occur intermittently at discrete instants of time. Third, a detailed theoretical analysis of cluster formability is carried out and a sufficient and necessary condition is provided such that the system is M-cluster formable. Furthermore, a discontinuous Lyapunov functional approach is developed to derive a design criterion on the existence of an admissible sampled-data CFP. Finally, numerical simulations on a team of nonholonomic mobile robots are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical result.

The proposed control strategy belongs to the leader-follower methodology. Each follower shares its state with neighboring agents, while also implementing local feedback that ensures stability. The role of the leaders is to provide a control law for the network of the followers in order to achieve asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero, which is accomplished by solving the regulator equations. Furthermore, the need for an observer design and thus communication between leaders is eliminated. Simulation results show superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other methods.

72|5228017|Conference Paper|2009|Mydhili K Nair|Net Mobile-Cop: A hybrid intelli-agent framework to manage networks|More than a decade ago, MA(mobile agents) were introduced for NM(network management) of distributed computer networks in tandem with the design paradigm of code-shipping the agents to remote node, where they are programmed to collect, analyze and process data locally. However, even today, most networks employ SNMP (simple network management protocol), an inherently client-server based stable and proven protocol, which uses the paradigm data-shipping. It suffers from the major drawback that when the network traffic increases, the manager is overloaded due to excessive processing. Real synergy could be achieved if we adopt a hybrid approach that brings the best of both paradigms. In this paper we present Net mobile-cophybrid NM framework, prototyped on Aglet mobile agent system and AdventNet SNMP Package, which imbibes this synergy. We also introduce a novel method to dynamically configure managed nodes using intelligent agents. We also provide quantitative evaluation leading to useful tips to the sys-admin as to when to toggle between SNMP and MA usage.

The controlled object consists of four agents that form a triangle formation system, where one agent acts as the vertex of the triangle, and the remaining agents act as followers in a line. Based on graph theory, the distributed adaptive updating of the agents'; local information parameters are conducted, and the distributed adaptive control law is used to supplement the influence of the leader';s fault in the multi-agent formation. According to the local information of adjacent agents, an overall distributed adaptive fault-tolerant control law is designed, and the stability of the designed controller is proved by constructing the Lyapunov function. Meanwhile, the relative distance error between the horizontal direction and longitudinal direction of the &#034;leader-follower&#034; converge to zero. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive control approach has good robustness, which provides a theoretical basis for engineering practice.

Phoha|Coordination of engineering design agents for high assurance in complex dynamic system design|This paper presents a hierarchical architecture for an innovative self-adaptive design network for physics-based modeling of complex systems dynamics in order to assess and control its behavior characteristics. Each structural component of the system is simulated by an engineering design agent (EDA) which models the conceptual design parameters of the component in its operational environment. The objective here is to iteratively achieve higher assurance of dynamic system behavior by trading off component design characteristics. A formal model of the design network is formulated in this paper as a finite set of interacting automata. Intelligent agents for design coordination and design supervision are introduced. The introduction of a high order polyadic process algebra-calculus (cost calculus)-allows the formulation of powerful algorithms for autonomous self-adaptation of the system design network to achieve high assurance specifications in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Ultimately the median is pulled to a lower or higher value depending on the summation of constraint based parameters or weights of the agents. Analysis showed the efficacy of the algorithm.
73|7119528|Conference Paper|2014|Najla Sassi|Using Multi-agent System to Solve Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems|Many problems in multi-agent systems can be described as Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (D CSPs), where the goal is to find a set of assignments to variables that satisfies all constraints among agents. However, when real-life application problems are formalized as DCSPs, they are often over-constrained and have no solution that satisfies all constraints. Moreover, the globalization of the economy and democratization of the Internet, boosted by the huge growth in information and communication technologies, have largely contributed to the expansion of numerous distributed architectures. Thus this paper provides a new distributed management and decision support system suitable to these interdependencies and these complex environments. We present a Distributed Optimization under Constraints Basic Relax (DOC-BRelax) as a new framework for dealing with over-constrained situations. We also present a version of this framework called DOC-Max Relax and a new algorithm for solving Distributed Maximal Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DMCSPs).

73|9102383|Journal Article|2020|Zeyu Han|Event-Triggered Synchronization for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems With Sampled Data|In this paper, the synchronization problem for networked nonlinear agents with time-varying control gain is studied under a synchronous periodic data sampling framework. To achieve synchronization, both the state-dependent and time-dependent event-triggered protocols are proposed. The effectiveness of these protocols is justified by Lyapunov stability theorem based on rigorous mathematical proof, facilitated by a delayed differential inequality with time-dependent parameters. Instead of specifying a lower bound for the control gain, as others usually suggested, our criteria rely on its time-average and thus allow higher flexibility in controller design. Numerical simulations are also presented to confirm the reaching of synchronization and demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed protocols.

And Lyapunov analysis is given to prove that the group consensus can be achieved under the designed control algorithm. Compared to existing results, this paper mainly designs the dynamical event-triggered law to achieve the group consensus rather than consensus or tracking, and the concerned agent is the nonlinear Euler-Lagrange system.

Gunathilaka|Exploiting Bulk Agent Approach for Conflict Resolution in Multi Agent Systems|Conflicts are inevitable when autonomous agents operating in Single Multi Agent System to achieve their own goals. Therefore various conflict resolution techniques were presented in the literature. Argumentation Based Negotiation (ABN) has been considered as one of the best approach so far. Evading and re- planning are also two different cost effective options which should be considered as the first option in resolving conflicts. On the other hand, nature can be considered as a one big natural multi agent environment, where all elementary agents interact with no visible conflicts. Cosmological studies and theories have been used to explain most of the natural phenomena that we scientifically experienced. How brane particles interacts each other in a universal extra dimension (bulk) and share the same governing rules such as gravity is the main inspiration for our research. We postulate that the conflicts can be avoided or resolved with minimal computational time and resources by introducing bulk agents which represent extra dimensions of a multi agent system.

74|6859441|Conference Paper|2014|Alireza Partovi|Assume-guarantee cooperative satisfaction of multi-agent systems|This paper aims to investigate the task decomposition problem of multi-agent systems. Task decomposition among agents refers to a process to decompose a given global task into subtasks for individual agents. The decomposition is not arbitrary and should be done in such a way that the satisfaction of the sub-tasks by all agents individually would imply the accomplishment of the global task collectively. In this paper, it is assumed that agents are modeled by labeled transition systems, and the global specification is given as a subclass of Computation Tree Logic (CTL) formulas. It is also assumed that the global CTL specification is broadcasted to and known by all agents. Agents could be heterogeneous and have different capabilities. In order to obtain subtasks for each agent with a maximum potential for fault tolerance, our basic idea is to let each agent contribute to their maximum capabilities in the sense of satisfying a maximum number of sub-formulas of the global specification. The maximum satisfaction set is achieved through a modified CTL model checking algorithm. These maximum satisfiable sub-formulas can be used as the subtask for the corresponding agent. Furthermore, based on assume-guarantee reasoning, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the satisfaction of the global CTL specification provided that each agent fullfill its own subtasks. A two-robot cooperative motion planning example is given to illustrate the results.

However, one of the severe challenges posed by the penetration of DGs to the utility grid system is the bi-directional power flows in the feeders. The bi-directional energy flows cause issues pertaining to the failures of protection systems because usually relays are designed to protect the network under unidirectional power flow case. Therefore, it is essential to have a robust protection scheme in support of distributed generators to protect the system from various faults. This paper proposes a novel protection scheme based on Q-learning and multi-agent system that identifies and isolates the different types of failure. The Q-learning algorithm is built to teach agents for making responsible decisions in fault identification and clearing. Furthermore, decentralized Blockchain based connections were adopted for exchanging information between agents. The system was simulated in MATLAB and JADE platforms and the results have shown that system is capable to identify different type of faults based on various states.

Agents have different and time varying beliefs on the state. As a consequence, when an agent chooses an action to execute, it is important for it to reason about what the beliefs of other agents may be and what are the consequent actions that other agents may take. We propose a decentralized solution based on the construction of empirical histograms of past actions using shared empirical histograms by neighboring agents and the use of best responses to the utility expectation with respect to the constructed histograms and the state belief. This algorithmic behavior is a variation of the fictitious play algorithm and is shown to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that if agents move towards a common belief on the state fast enough, their behavior is a Nash equilibrium of the game with the utility given by the expectation of the global objective with respect to the common belief. We numerically analyze the algorithm in a target covering game.

74|782345|Conference Paper|1999|T.S. Perraju|Multi-agent architectures for high assurance systems|High assurance encompasses availability, security, safety and any other features that affect the predictability of the system. Techniques from disciplines like fault tolerant computing, real time systems and reliability engineering are applied to improve one or many of the features listed above. This ad hoc approach severely limits the systems capabilities and often leads to brittle systems. High assurance systems engineering attempts to adopt a holistic approach to the problem of designing mission critical systems. Multi-agent architectures are a new paradigm in conceptualizing, designing and implementing systems. Agent architectures are characterized by the concepts of situatedness, autonomy and flexibility. These characteristics are essential for building high assurance mission critical systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent based approach for designing high assurance systems.

75|6896805|Conference Paper|2014|Bin Zhou|Consensus of delayed multi-agent systems by reduced-order observer based truncated predictor feedback protocols|For high-order linear multi-agent systems with large input and communication delays, a predictor feedback approach is established to design reduced-order observer based output feedback protocols. This approach can compensate arbitrarily large delays but will lead to infinite dimensional protocols. Under the assumption that the open-loop dynamics is at most polynomially unstable, the proposed predictor feedback protocols are truncated by removing the distributed terms, resulting in finite dimensional reduced-order observer based output feedback protocols, which will be referred to as truncated predictor feedback (TPF) protocols. Compared with the predictor feedback protocols, the main advantage of the TPF protocols is that it is very easy to implement. Two numerical examples are worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

75|8778306|Conference Paper|2019|Dagmawi Neway Mekuria|A Probabilistic Multi-Agent System Architecture for Reasoning in Smart Homes|Uncertainty is inevitable in ambient assisted living (AAL) environments as sensors may read inaccurate data or due to the existence of unobserved variables for privacy reasons. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the home environment and vague human communications may result in ambiguous, incomplete and inconsistent contextual information, which ultimately lead the smart home system into uncertainty. This paper aims to tackle some of these challenges, in particular, uncertainty due to vague human communication and missing information in ambient environments. For this, we proposed a probabilistic multi-agent system architecture for reasoning in smart homes by utilizing the notion of multiagent systems (MAS) technologies and probabilistic logic programming techniques. Accordingly, this study shows how the probabilistic reasoning technique enables the agents to reason under uncertainty. Furthermore, it discusses how the intelligent agents enhance their decision-making process by exchanging information about missing data or unobservable variables using agent interaction protocols. In general, the study demonstrates that the combination of MAS technologies and probabilistic logic programming can help in building a reasoning system, which is capable of performing well under vague inhabitant commands and missing information in a partially observable environment.

In this scheme, the individual primary voltage controllers and the secondary controller are represented as a set of execution agents and a coordination agent, respectively, who work either independently or coordinately to control the system-wide voltage level. According to the principles of the multi-agent system (MAS), the optimal coordination methods among voltage controllers in normal operating condition and in system contingencies are investigated respectively. Under normal conditions, the multi-agent based control system works as a conventional secondary voltage control system, realizing global optimal var/voltage control. When system runs into contingencies, contract net protocol, which is widely used in MAS, are introduced to realize coordination and cooperation among voltage control agents for eliminating voltage violation. The simulation results of the New England 39-bus system show that the proposed control scheme and coordination method are very effective in managing global voltage profile of power system as well as settling local voltage violation problems in system contingencies.

Finally, numerical simulation is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.
75|5189815|Conference Paper|2009|Mahsa Chitsaz|A Multi-agent System Approach for Medical Image Segmentation|Image segmentation still requires improvements although there have been research works since the last few decades. This is coming due to some issues. Firstly, most image segmentation solutions are problem-based. Secondly, medical image segmentation methods generally have restrictions because medical images have very similar gray level and texture among the interested objects. The goal of this work is to design a framework to extract simultaneously several objects of interest from Computed Tomography (CT) images by using some priori-knowledge. Our method used properties of agent in a multi-agent environment. The input image is divided into several sub-images, and each agent works on a sub-image and tries to mark each pixel as a specific region by means of given priori-knowledge. During this time the local agent marks each cell of sub-image individually. Moderator agent checks the outcome of all agentspsila work to produce final segmented image. The experimental results for cranial CT images demonstrated segmentation accuracy around 90%.
75|8470984|Journal Article|2019|Yosra Jarraya|A Multi-Agent Architecture for the Design of Hierarchical Interval Type-2 Beta Fuzzy System|This paper presents a new methodology for building and evolving hierarchical fuzzy systems. For the system design, a tree-based encoding method is adopted to hierarchically link low-dimensional fuzzy systems. Such tree structural representation has by nature a flexible design offering more adjustable and modifiable structures. The proposed hierarchical structure employs a type-2 beta fuzzy system to cope with the faced uncertainties, and the resulting system is called the hierarchical interval type-2 beta fuzzy system (HT2BFS). For the system optimization, two main tasks of structure learning and parameter tuning are applied. The structure learning phase aims to evolve and learn the structures of a population of the HT2BFS in a multi-objective context taking into account the optimization of both the accuracy and the interpretability metrics. The parameter tuning phase is applied to refine and adjust the parameters of the system. To accomplish these two tasks in the most optimal way, we further employ a multi-agent architecture to provide both a distributed and a cooperative management of the optimization tasks. Agents are divided into two different types based on their functions: a structure agent and a parameter agent. The main function of the structure agent is to perform a multi-objective evolutionary structure learning step by means of the multi-objective immune programming algorithm. The parameter agents have the function of managing different hierarchical structures simultaneously to refine their parameters by means of the hybrid harmony search algorithm. In this architecture, agents use cooperation and communication concepts to create high-performance HT2BFSs. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by several comparisons with various state-of-the-art approaches on noise-free and noisy time series prediction datasets and regression problems. The results clearly demonstrate a great improvement in accuracy rate, convergence speed, and the number of used rules as compared to other existing approaches.

Divya|A multi-agent based intelligent query processing system for Hadoop with FIPA-OS using cooperating agent in cloud environment|The cloud provides a flexible environment for customers to host and process their information. Many applications dealing with massive data and complex queries are routed to the cloud. The response time depends on query optimization and resource scheduling. There are several techniques to optimize the query and resource scheduling but the information about the query is not stored i.e. the frequent queries will recursively do the same set of procedures. Hence, to reduce the time consumed by redundant query processing procedure we introduce agents in Hadoop framework (JobTracker). As JobTracker is a single point of failure i.e. if this goes down, all running jobs are halted. Therefore, we introduce agents in place of JobTracker to intellectually process the query and assign the task to TaskTrackers. Here we use FIPA-OS (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) toolkit enabling rapid development interacting agent based system in the JADE (Java Agent Development Environment) platform.

75|9640583|Early Access Article|2021|Liwei An|Distributed Optimal Coordination for Heterogeneous Linear Multi-Agent Systems|This paper studies the problem of distributed optimal coordination (DOC) for heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems. Compared with the existing results where the structure constraints on local gradients or system matrices are required, the considered DOC framework is sufficiently general in the sense that no extra assumption is required except for the convexity/differentiability of local objective functions and the controllability/observability of linear systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the solution to the DOC problem is proposed in terms of the relationship between the objective function and so-called convergence-reachable set of linear systems. Under this fundamental condition, the original DOC problem is transformed into the one with additive equality constraint, without loss of the optimality, which generates a trackable solution for agent dynamics. By using a new state transformation technique, it is proved that the proposed DOC algorithm guarantees the global asymptotical convergence by utilizing only local interaction. Simulation results on the motion coordination illustrate the proposed algorithm.

These objectives can be achieved by applying suitable and promising optimization algorithms and techniques. This paper presents a demand side management strategy which was integrated into the existing Home Energy Management System (HEMS). Home energy management system is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) based decentralized architecture proposed by the authors. This intelligent energy management system was developed on an IEEE FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) compliant multi-agent platform. This enables agents to communicate, interact and negotiate with energy sources and devices of the smart home to provide the most efficient energy usage and minimize the cost of electricity bills. This also results some peak load shaving of the power distribution system of the smart home. Simulation studies show the potential of proposed multi-agent system technique together with the demand side management strategy to provide the optimum solution for smart home energy management.

Mechanisms and models to implement early warning credit risk systems have been put in place to aid business risk managers make well-informed decisions. With the establishment of credit reference bureaus (CRB), it';s imperative to have a real-time mechanism of collecting data, analyzing it and reporting the knowledge in it.

On one hand it is argued that we witness an overall shift towards market-like coordination of business transactions, whereas others argue that we face more hierarchy-like coordination. In this paper a multi-agent system is described that globally coordinates a multiple step value chain either way by using local optimization rules of self-interested autonomous agents. In further research it will be analyzed how changes in setup parameters (e.g. transaction costs, cooperational behavior) will effect the predominant coordination mechanism among the artificial life agents.

To satisfy the requirement of multi-agent systems, the input shaping technique is extended to solve the control of an oscillation system with non-zero initial position firstly. The distributed fixed-time controllers are proposed based on the shaped command to achieve rest-to-rest maneuver of multi-agent systems under connected undirected graph where there is at least one node linked to the leader. For the directed graph with a globally reachable leader and no circle, distributed fixed-time controllers are designed by placing input shapers in all communication edges in the graph. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

75|4620532|Conference Paper|2008|Yu-Lan Ma|An auction-based multi-agent system model with variable use-factor|Agents often need to work together and achieve their common and individual goals under the environment where there are limited or scarce resources. How to allocate these resources efficiently is critical in proceeding of cooperation and competition. Auction-based method is often adopted in the settings. This paper presents an improved mathematically computable model based auction theory by introducing a variable use-factor. In this model, there is a seller agent with multi-item goods to sell while many buyer agents want to buy the goods. By analyzing optional bidding and numerical computing, it is found that the variable use-factor influences obviously the agents‚Äô utility and bidding. This model is beneficial for the future mechanisms design both in agent-based software engineering and various distributed system, especially Internet-based commerce applications.

Edutainment software tries to capitalize on this however, it has failed in reaching the levels of motivation and engagement seen in mainstream games. In this context, we have integrated a mainstream first-person shooter game, counter-strike, into the curriculum of our autonomous agents and multi-agent systems course. In this paper we describe this integration and a platform to support the creation of counter-strike agents. In addition, a questionnaire was posed to our students to assess the success of our approach. Results show that students found the idea of applying a first- person-shooter game motivating and the integration with the curriculum useful for their education.
76|6669555|Conference Paper|2013|Nikolaos Kariotoglou|Hierarchical task allocation for multi-agent systems encoded by stochastic reachability specifications|We consider the problem of satisfying a set of objectives over a collection of agents. For a single agent, the optimal solution can be obtained via a stochastic reachability framework where optimal control policies come along with a performance metric, defined as the probability of successfully achieving a specified objective. As the number of agents increases, the approach quickly becomes computationally expensive and often intractable. We propose a method which includes an advisory controller that allocates tasks among agents based on their ability of handling individual objectives. This ability is encoded by the stochastic reachability performance metrics. The proposed method is tailored to an autonomous surveillance system composed of pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras and verified experimentally.
76|9002956|Conference Paper|2019|Adarsh Kesireddy|Global Optimal Path Planning for Multi-agent Flocking: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach with NSGA-III|Flocking is a multi-objective operation performed by multiple agents in uncertain environments. Objectives of flocking include reaching target for each agent, avoiding collision with obstacles and other agents, as well as maintaining certain pattern among all agents. Multi-objective optimization can be performed in priori methods, posteriori methods and scalarizing methods. Pareto front optimization is the best way to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. To date, flocking has been performed with summation of objective values. In this paper, Pareto front optimization is adopted for the first time for flocking simulation for multi-agents in uncertain environments. For a team of agents, e.g. rovers, in an uncertain environment, Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithm (CCEA) performs well for both exploration and exploitation. CCEAs coupled with Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and NSGA-III are performed to achieve flocking for multi-agents. A new reward structure is introduced for CCEA. In order to check the reward structure, flocking is performed in different environment, open and closed. In addition, the performances of NSGA-II and NSGA-III are compared for various cases of flocking with different numbers of objectives. Towards the end, the effectiveness of the developed methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations.
76|7819141|Conference Paper|2016|Tiago Santos|A system reconfiguration architecture for hybrid automation systems based in agents and programmable logic controllers|As web related technologies continue to find their way into production related activities, their true potential can only be explored with a shop floor that is cyber-physically agile. This means the ability to quickly reconfigure a production system during production changeovers while significantly reducing setup times and non value-adding activities keeping the overall performance of the control system. Currently, system reconfiguration in mainly supported by reprogramming. However, reprogramming of large complex systems is often a time consuming and risky activity since it has a non negligible potential for introducing errors which normally result in long debugging times. In this context, this paper details an agent-based system architecture that enables quick system reconfiguration and minimizes the reprogramming effort. For this purpose a production system is abstracted as a multiagent system that dynamically interacts with a native, programmable-logic-controller-based control system and is able to re-parametrize it. The focus on re-parametrization means that the native system can still operate in the absence of the agent system which improves the overall robustness of the solution, using readily available equipment and enables its integration with legacy systems.

Organization in such large-scale systems, becomes therefore a very relevant concept in research on LSMAS, as the mentioned agents are expected to cooperate, compete, and share information, hence improving quality of peoples'; life. An example application domain of LSMAS are massive multi-player online games (MMOG), and their specific genre ‚Äî MMO role-playing games (MMORPG). MMORPGs provide us with the opportunity to study both large-scale virtual interaction of players (agents), and coordination of large-scale distributed artificial intelligence.

Combining these two ontologies with a special accent on identifying elements and aspects of organization, will hopefully present us with a basis for LSMAS structures which follow organizational constraints and are suitable for LSMAS development in the MMORPG context.
76|6611497|Conference Paper|2013|R. Bharat Menon|Fuzzy logic decision-making in multi-agent systems for smart grids|Multi-agent Systems (MAS) are the new paradigms for building and understanding Distributed Energy Systems (DES). MAS are an efficient problem solving methodology, which has gained popularity among researchers all over the world. One important advantage of these systems are that, once the researchers gain more knowledge about MAS, they can integrate them with more new features thereby being able to solve more complex problems. In MAS, every component is modeled as an intelligent agent capable of working autonomously. This study presents an innovative and sophisticated approach for the representation of a DES. A co-operation algorithm is devised to understand how efficiently the agents work in accordance with each other. Based on preset rules and definitions, the agents of the MAS can decide how much power each source has to contribute in accordance to the varying load conditions and cooperation between agents. A five-layered Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is designed to implement this decision-making ability of the agents. All the decisions taken are further stored in a rule-repository which is used by the FLC as a knowledge base for learning and making better decisions in the future.

In this setting, the network system is often attacked maliciously, and the spoofed agent will affect the convergence state of the network. For this problem, the channel of the wireless WiFi signal is measured, and the weight value that changes with time is set according to the experimental measurement value.

The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by comparing simulation examples in different cases.

The agents are high-order linear systems subject to external disturbances and plant uncertainties, the input to the leader is not known to other agents, and the network topology is time-varying. We adopt a recently developed reduced-order disturbance observer to present a distributed tracking controller which uses only relative measurements. It is shown that the proposed controller can be tuned to ensure the ultimate boundedness of tracking error which can be chosen arbitrarily small despite the network switching, plant uncertainties, and disturbances. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

They will have the ability to seamlessly integrate with smart applications that have not been explicitly designed to work together. Traditional software engineering approaches offer limited support for the development of intelligent systems. To handle the tremendous complexity and the new engineering challenges presented by intelligence, adaptiveness and seamless integration, developers need higher-level development constructs. Agent concepts are natural to describe intelligent adaptive systems. Agent-based technologies have been incorporating software engineering practices, and have matured to offer useful insights and concrete practices to mainstream software engineers. This tutorial presents the state of the art in agent development from a software engineering perspective, focusing on practices that are applicable today. We have walked the audience through analysis, design and verification of a portion of a real-world problem, a smart home network. We show how agent concepts more naturally match the engineering challenges of such systems like trust between adaptive components. The audience had a hands-on experience with analyzing, and designing parts of the smart home network and learn how to incorporate agent technologies into their current projects.

The methodological starting point relies on a smart use of predictive arguments with a twofold aim: 1) Promptly detect malicious agent behaviors affecting normal system operations; 2) Apply specific control actions, based on predictive ideas, for mitigating as much as possible undesirable domino effects resulting from adversary operations. Specifically, the multi-agent system is topologically described by a leader-follower digraph characterized by a unique leader and set-theoretic receding horizon control ideas are exploited to develop a distributed algorithm capable to instantaneously recognize the attacked agent. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to show benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Simulation studies carried out on the proposed system shows its potential to provide the optimal solutions to achieve better electricity distribution efficiency and electricity bill price. This paper demonstrates how the influences of different level of EMS with MAS decision making system will affect the smart grid.
76|5381060|Conference Paper|2009|R. Beheshti|Predicting Opponents Offers in Multi-agent Negotiations Using ARTMAP Neural Network|Negotiations are one of the most common ways that agents in a multi-agent system use to reach agreements. As negotiations commonly are multi-lateral and multi-issue, these processes become more difficult. Moreover, in real-world applications in which real-time agents are needed, this issue becomes more important. Autonomous agents should be able to decide what to propose in each round of negotiations quickly. In this situation if an agent is able to predict opponent';s behavior including its next offer, the task of offering comes to be more efficient. This paper presents an approach in which an agent can predict opponent';s next offer using a history of previous offers and counter-offers by the aid of ARTMAP Neural Network. The agent can employ this information to determine its offer after a &#034;what-if&#034; analysis of possible offers. The experimental results show that this approach substantially decreases the duration of negotiations and can be used in real applications as well.

The presented framework proposes an hybrid cognitive architecture that relies on subsumption theory and includes some important extensions. These extensions can be condensed in inclusion of learning capabilities through bio-inspired reinforcement machine learning systems, an evolutionary mechanism based on gene expression programming to self-configure the behaviour arbitration between layers, a co-evolutionary mechanism to evolve behaviour repertories in a parallel fashion and finally, an aggregation mechanism to combine the learning algorithms outputs to improve the learning quality and increase the robustness and fault tolerance ability of the cognitive agent. The proposed architecture was proved in an animate environment using a multi-agent platform where several learning capabilities and emergent properties for self-configuring internal agent';s architecture arise.

76|4530302|Conference Paper|2008|Sawsan Saad|The Flexible Negotiation Ontology-based Knowledge Management System: The Transport Ontology Case Study|In this paper, we address the problem of negotiation process in a multi-agents system by using ontologies. Therefore, we present an ontology solution based on the knowledge management system for semantic heterogeneity. The proposed solution prevents the misunderstanding during the negotiation process though the agents'; communications. Our approach aims to make the agents able to understand each other when using these ontologies. Thus, we propose a general architecture for Negotiation process which uses ontology-based knowledge management system (NOKMS). This architecture consists of three layers: the negotiation layer (NL) that describes the negotiation process between the initiator static agents (ISAs) and the participant mobile agents (PMAs) by using suitable ontologies, the Semantic Layer (SEL) contains the semantic translator which uses in the case of misunderstanding of the sent messages between the agents, and the last one is the knowledge management systems layer (KMSL) which bases on the intelligent knowledge base (IKB) to give the flexibility to our negotiation ontology. Finally, we present a case study which applies our architecture on the multimodal transport information system (MTIS) project where we will show tow scenarios applicable: the first uses our negotiation ontology architecture in one transport system, and the second applies this architecture on the multi-transport systems. These cases studies show that the proposed NOKMS improves the execution of negotiation process in multi-agents systems in order to satisfy the transport customers.

Therefore, the architecture is developed in a distributed perspective and is composed of three basic layers: the low level that constitutes the interface between the architecture and the infrastructure. The intermediate level that is responsible of correlating the alerts coming from different domains of the infrastructure and to deploy the reaction actions. The architecture is elaborated using a MAS associated to the OntoBayes model for decision mechanism. This model helps agents to make decisions according to preference values and is built upon ontology based knowledge sharing, Bayesian networks based uncertainty management and influence diagram. The major novelty of this Decision Support System is the layered view of the infrastructure thanks to MAS architecture, which enables the decision making with different levels of knowledge.

The proposed approach recommends the amount of energy reduction that should be applied in a building in each moment, by learning from previous similar cases. The k-nearest neighbor clustering algorithm is applied to identify the most similar past cases, and an approach based on support vector machines is used to optimize the weight of different parameters that characterize each case. An expert system composed by a set of ad hoc rules guarantees that the solution is adequate and applicable to the new case scenario. The proposed CBR methodology is modeled through a dedicated software agent, thus enabling its integration in a multi-agent systems society for the study of energy systems. Results show that the proposed approach is able to provide suitable recommendations on energy reduction, by comparing its results with a previous approach based on particle swarm optimization and with the real reduction in past cases. The applicability of the proposed approach in real scenarios is also assessed through the application of the results provided by the proposed approach on a house energy resources management system.

Shanmuga Priya|Learning agent based knowledge management in Intelligent Tutoring System|An Intelligent Tutoring System is helpful for the users who want to undertake a learning process. This paper presents an intelligent tutoring system based on learning agent and knowledge agents to improve the learning and teaching process of the tutoring session. The agents involved are knowledge acquirement agent, knowledge sharing agent, knowledge maintenance agent and learning agent. The knowledge acquirement agent is responsible for the construction of the student model and the domain knowledge base. The knowledge sharing agent is responsible for producing personalized teaching web pages to students dynamically.

To this aim, a new regulation protocol for the closed-loop multi-agent system under a directed graph is proposed. An important specification of the proposed protocol is to guarantee the leader-following output regulation for uncertain multi-agent systems with both stable and unstable agents. Since many signals can be approximated by a combination of the stationary and ramp signals, the presented results work for adequate variety of the leaders. The analysis and design conditions are presented in terms of certain matrix inequalities. The method proposed can be used for both stationary and ramp leaders. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Human learns incidents by own actions and reflects them on the subsequent actions as own experiences. These experiences are memorized in his/her brain and recollected and reused if necessary. This research incorporates such an intelligent information processing mechanism, and applies it to an autonomous agent that has three main functions that is, learning, memorization and associative recollection. In the proposed system, an actor-critic type reinforcement learning method is used for learning. For memorization, we introduce the chaotic auto-associative model that is proposed by Chartier, and that is also used like mutual associative memory system. Moreover, to deal with the increase of information, the memory part has an adaptive hierarchical layered structure of the memory module that consists of chaotic neural networks, especially for multi-valued pattern. Finally, the effectiveness of this proposed method is verified through the simulation applied to the maze-searching problem.

But on-demand computation means only a small amount of RI are new and need to be updated in RI table (RIT) in each computation. In order to save the bandwidth of transmitting RITs, we design a multi-agent cooperative system, in which one monitoring agent initiatively checks up the RIT in succession and acquires the new updated information, delivers to other routers. The dispose agent receives the new RI and updates local RIT. The simulation experiment proves that the method is highly effective and practical

Communication delays as one kind of channel constrains in multi-agent systems have been discussed in the recent literature. Different from those works, consensus problem with communication channel constraint on signal amplitude is addressed in this paper. Our work shows that the consensus can be obtained as long as some state-dependent switching parameters are introduced into the consensus protocol. It is shown that the system given by the proposed protocol can reach globally asymptotically consensus and that the system can also achieve a generalized average-consensus if the directed graph is balanced. An example has been proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

In the model, a manger agent has been set to watch activities of other agents. It will encourage the cooperative sellers and punish the non-cooperative seller agents by adjust the sellerpsilas reputation in the repository. With this mechanism, a seller would complete the trade with the buyer although he doesn';t have enough items and the stock of the seller need not too much. The model is simulated in a multi-agent simulation platform - JADE. The experimental results show that this cooperation mechanism widens the bound of cooperation among the sellers and saves the stock cost of the sellers.

The power generation and the load demand of the system should be balanced while satisfying the system';s operating constraints in real-time to make the system operate normally. This paper presents a multi-agent system for the next generation integrated power system (NG IPS) in high/medium voltage level to coordinate a group of agents to cooperatively achieve the real-time load management objectives. The generator agent layer and load agent layer are designed to integrate a group of generators, propulsion loads, and DC zones into the multi-agent system. The cooperative control protocol is developed based on the proposed artificial potential function to achieve the group goals in real-time. The simulation results show that the developed technique achieves the real-time load management objectives.
77|4118532|Conference Paper|2005|Javed Mostafa|Automated text classification using a multi-agent framework|Automatic text classification is an important operational problem in digital library practice. Most text classification efforts so far concentrated on developing centralized solutions. However, centralized classification approaches often are limited due to constraints on knowledge and computing resources. In addition, centralized approaches are more vulnerable to attacks or system failures and less robust in dealing with them. We present a decentralized approach and system implementation (named MACCI) for text classification using a multi-agent framework. Experiments are conducted to compare our multi-agent approach with a centralized approach. The results show multi-agent classification can achieve promising classification results while maintaining its other advantages

A system is defined in this paper as a set of networked devices, where each of which has its own operating system, a processor to execute related periodic software tasks, and a local battery. A reconfiguration is any operation allowing the addition-removal-update of tasks to adapt the device and the whole system to its environment. It may be a reaction to a fault or even optimization of the system functional behavior. Nevertheless, such scenario can cause the violation of real-time or energy constraints, which is considered as a critical run-time problem. We propose a multi-agent adaptive architecture to handle dynamic reconfigurations and ensure the correct execution of the concurrent real-time distributed tasks under energy constraints. The proposed architecture integrates a centralized scheduler agent (ScA) which is the common decision making element for the scheduling problem. It is able to carry out the required run-time solutions based on operation research techniques and mathematical tools for the system';s feasibility. This architecture assigns also a reconfiguration agent (RA

The leader and follower agents are of different dynamics, and the follower agents are affected by disturbances generated by the leader agents through directed paths in the communication topology. The control objective of the output containment control is to drive the output trajectories of the follower agents to converge to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of the leader agents in the presence of disturbances. Low gain feedback containment protocols are constructed based on the output regulation approach and distributed observers. It is shown that semi-global output containment control can be achieved by the proposed protocols, if each follower agent is connected to at least one leader agent through a directed path in the communication topology. Simulation results verify the theoretical conclusions.

For smart operation this challenges the current centralized management systems. To deal with this and to optimize cost and energy efficiency a multi-agent approach is proposed, which to a certain extent is similar to agent systems developed for and tested in electricity grids. This study describes the physical and technical properties of a P2P solution which is based on experiences in both electricity grids and climate systems for buildings. Some vital issues of this approach are discussed and technical directions chosen are substantiated. The P2P system called HeatMatcher is tested in simulations with the heat network designed and run in a Matlab/Simulink environment. Results of a field test in a small thermal grid in an apartment complex in the Netherlands are presented.
77|5610625|Conference Paper|2010|Khan A. Basit|Towards an engineering of multi-agent eco-systems|Different approaches for engineering multi-agent systems have been proposed over time. However, there is a lack of attention towards the social aspects of multi-agent systems. In this paper we present an approach for engineering multi-agent systems, which considers multi-agent systems as digital ecologies. Different agent ecologies can work together and act as digital ecosystem. In such ecosystem the social aspects of the agents are well defined and all the subcomponents of the multi-agent system work together to achieve a fine integration of the whole ecosystem. Instead of focusing on internal model of software agents our methodology attempts to capture the dynamic and social behaviors of agents by focusing on the cooperation, coordination, negotiation and management attributes of the system. From implementation point of view, the proposed engineering methodology is grounded in our multi-agent framework and the concepts developed using this methodology can be mapped to implementation easily. The framework provides support for integration of web-services and uses peer-to-peer approach for resource discovering.

Piza|Virtual sensors for dynamic virtual environments|This paper proposes a sensor-based mechanism that allows virtual creatures to perceive the environment that surrounds them. We are keen on modeling the behavior of real-life creatures via VR-techniques. Every living creature is endowed by a number of senses, by means of which, the creature is aware of the world around. We picture the environment as a multi-agent system, where every agent has, primarily, a knowledge base, a sensors and effectors to allow interaction. The effectors may launch actions (graphical changes), noises, messages or aromas. The sensors model, particularly, the sight, hearing and smell senses of a living creature. Every sensor has specific perception capabilities and gathers partial or full information about the objects around. Through the sensors, a virtual creature is aware of the environment and capable to increase the knowledge base. The local state of a creature can be amplified by allowing cooperation between agents

In this paper, we consider a multi-agent swarm- based system for performing tasks in a domain characterized by search and execute operations. Our main focus is on the task allocation problem among the swarm units in our system. The main contribution of this paper is a multi- agent auction-based algorithm with dynamically adjustable bids that enables a swarm unit (agent) to plan its path efficiently while maintaining certain constraints on its cost and on the completion times of the tasks in the system. Experimental results of our algorithm within a simulated environment show that the auction-based algorithm performs significantly better than other heuristics-based strategies.

By introducing an extra compensator, an augmented error system is obtained to circumvent the requirement of system dynamics. An optimal consensus control parameter is obtained by using iterative ADP algorithm, which not only makes the cost function close to the optimal value but also drives MAS realize consensus. Several properties of the finite-horizon iterative algorithm are proved theoretically. Then, the action network and the critic network are introduced to realize the proposed algorithm. The critic network approximates the cost function and the control parameter is constructed by action network. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme proposed in this paper.

78|6968355|Conference Paper|2014|Divya Lohani|Multi-Agent data aggregation in wireless sensor network using source grouping|Mobile agents in wireless sensor networks provide many advantages in comparison of conventional client/server architecture. Mobile Agents follow code to data approach and thus perform the task of data aggregation at the nodes rather than at the processing element. This approach reduces in-network data transmission, thus improving bandwidth usage and prolonging network lifetime. Use of multiple mobile agents instead of single mobile agent allows the task to get completed in a cooperative manner. In this paper, we present a multi agent solution for data aggregation using source grouping along with tree based ordering. Extensive simulations have proved better results in terms of energy consumed and latency in comparison of other approaches.

Mudgal|An influence diagram model for multi-agent negotiation|Bilateral negotiation is an important aspect of e-commerce to bring satisfactory agreement in business transactions. Though auction-based models are more common currently, they are unable to accommodate tradeoffs between multiple parameters. This makes them inappropriate when trading with intangible goods, like information, expertise and help. We approach e-commerce and negotiation in the context of a distributed multi-agent peer help system, I-Help, supporting students in a university course. Personal agents keep models of student preferences and negotiate on their behalf to acquire information resources (help) from other agents. Negotiation is modeled using an influence diagram, a decision theoretic tool. Agents create models of their opponents during negotiation, which help them predict better the opponent actions. The experiments show that the proposed approach brings better deals to the agent who uses it. However, if both negotiating agents use this approach, the negotiation fails more often.

Each agent is assigned a local convex cost function and the agents collectively wish to minimize the sum of all the cost functions. Under the assumption that the agent dynamics are first order and the agents communicate according to a strongly connected and weight-balanced digraph, we present a distributed algorithm to minimize the cost function. This algorithm is a discrete-time counterpart of similar algorithms that have been proposed in the literature for continuous time systems. We show that the algorithm converges exponentially to the optimal solution. We further extend the algorithm to consider an event triggered implementation that reduces the communication among the agents at the cost of a lower convergence rate.

This approach is performed by an agent-based architecture where all systems, both products and manufacturing systems, have an agent that represents them. This is seen as a new manufacturing paradigm, called Grid Manufacturing. Grids can ideally be set up in such a way that a range of products can be produced dynamically and in parallel, depending on the demand the logistic systems might even be configured in such a way that products can move freely between manufacturing systems to offer more flexibility. This paper describes the necessary steps for the decomposition of the product definition, the manufacturing process and the involved architecture. The chosen platforms to perform these tasks are Multi Agent Systems and Robot Operating System, to create a hybrid architecture that fully utilizes performance, stability and the dynamic behavior of these distributed platforms. As a result the manufacturing systems can easily be adapted to the current product demand, which shortens the time to market for new products and makes it easier to scale the production means. This is especially interesting for high mix, low volume production, which is becoming more important in the high-tech and creative industry.

As utility independent private microgrids are installed constantly, standardized interoperability frameworks are required to define behavioral models of the individual agents for expandability and plug-and-play operation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive hybrid agent framework combining the foundation for intelligent physical agents (FIPA), IEC 61850, and data distribution service (DDS) standards. The IEC 61850 logical node concept is extended using FIPA based agent communication language (ACL) with application specific attributes and deliberative behavior modeling capability. The DDS middleware is adopted to enable a real-time publisher-subscriber interoperability mechanism between platforms. The proposed multi-agent framework was validated in a laboratory based testbed involving developed intelligent electronic device (IED) prototypes and actual microgrid setups. Experimental results were demonstrated for both decentralized and distributed control approaches. Secondary and tertiary control levels of a microgrid were demonstrated for decentralized hierarchical control case study. A consensus-based economic dispatch case study was demonstrated as a distributed control example. It was shown that the developed agent platform is industrially applicable for actual smart grid field deployment.

In the past decades, multi-agent control and tracking algorithms have attracted more and more attention. Among them, the control problem of multi-agent has become the research focus of scholars. As an important aspect of multi-agent control problem, formation control has also made considerable development. It has played an important role in the fields of industry, civil affairs and military affairs [1]. Multi-agent formation has obvious advantages compared with the task of single agent, it can accomplish more and more complex tasks, and the efficiency of the task is greatly improved. The failure of a single agent in the system will not significantly affect the completion of the overall task. In order to improve the efficiency of multi-agent system, it is very necessary to study the task of multi-agent coordination. At present, the widely used intelligent formation tracking system includes the target detection and tracking system of unmanned aerial vehicle formation, the ground vehicle object tracking and detection system and the detection and tracking system of the sea surface ship area target.

The system studied has the following characteristics: (i) there are many agents in this system and the state of each agent dynamically evolves with time; (ii) for each agent, its state evolves like an ARMAX model with unknown coefficients; (iii) each agent is locally intervened by neighborhood agents with unknown linear reactions; (iv) each agent can only use its history information and local information on its neighborhood agents to design its control law aimed at achieving its own local goal, i.e. tracking a local signal sequence. In this paper, the Astrom-Wittenmark self-tuning regulator, which is a special ease (with known high-frequency gain) of extended least squares (ELS) algorithm, is adopted by each agent to estimate the local unknown parameters (including internal parameters and coupling coefficients) and control the local states based on the &#034;certainty equivalence&#034; principle. For the decentralized Astrom-Wittenmark self-tuning regulator discussed here, its stability and optimality are established rigorously in this paper.

The considered switching topology is assumed to be sequentially connected, which is directed disconnected. The combinational measurement approach is adopted in the event-triggering strategy such that each agent updates control rule only at its own event-triggering instants. First, by using the iterative method, we establish the recursive relationship of maximal distance sequence. Then, sufficient conditions of event-based bounded consensus can be obtained by the contractive property of maximal distance sequence. Meanwhile, it is proved that the designed event-triggering rule can avoid Zeno behavior. Furthermore, as an extension, we consider the case of jointly connected topology, and the corresponding consensus problem is also explored. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to confirm the derived theoretical results.

Different from most of existing distributed optimization literature, we assume the decision variables here are determined as outputs of linear agents. The design goal is to find distributed feedbacks for these high-order agents and collectively minimize the sum of individual objective functions. To overcome the difficulties brought by high-order dynamics, we first construct a dynamic estimator to generate the global optimal point, and then embed this estimator to some proper tracking controllers for these agents. The resultant control is shown to solve the formulated problem with some mild assumptions.

Usually, optimal control is designed based on the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, but it is very difficult to solve the equation because of the unknown dynamic and inherent nonlinearity. Specifically, to multi-agent systems, it will become more complicated owing to the state coupling problem in control design. In order to achieve the optimized control, the reinforcement learning algorithm of the identifier-actor-critic architecture is implemented based on fuzzy logic system (FLS) approximators. The identifier is designed for estimating the unknown multi-agent dynamics; the actor and critic FLSs are constructed for executing control behavior and evaluating control performance, respectively. According to Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the desired optimizing performance can be arrived. Finally, a simulation example is carried out to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
79|8929168|Conference Paper|2019|Tianze Luo|Multi-Agent Collaborative Exploration through Graph-based Deep Reinforcement Learning|Autonomous exploration by a single or multiple agents in an unknown environment leads to various applications in automation, such as cleaning, search and rescue, etc. Traditional methods normally take frontier locations and segmented regions of the environment into account to efficiently allocate target locations to different agents to visit. They may employ ad hoc solutions to allocate the task to the agents, but the allocation may not be efficient. In the literature, few studies focused on enhancing the traditional methods by applying machine learning models for agent performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph-based deep reinforcement learning approach to effectively perform multi-agent exploration. Specifically, we first design a hierarchical map segmentation method to transform the environment exploration problem to the graph domain, wherein each node of the graph corresponds to a segmented region in the environment and each edge indicates the distance between two nodes. Subsequently, based on the graph structure, we apply a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to allocate the exploration target to each agent. Our experiments show that our proposed model significantly improves the efficiency of map explorations across varying sizes of collaborative agents over the traditional methods.

Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the proposed protocol to solve the considered consensus problem. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of compensation for networked delays using the provided consensus algorithm.

The nonlinear dynamics of the agents are handled by a class of nonlinear control laws. It is first proved that each controlled agent admits a positively invariant set if the outputs of the neighboring agents are bounded. Then, by showing the existence of a positively invariant set for the multi-agent system, the state boundedness of the multi-agent system is guaranteed, and strong output-agreement is proved by showing that the size of the positively invariant set is reducing. An example with simulation is employed to show the effectiveness of the main result.
79|5665369|Conference Paper|2010|Tsutomu Miki|A simple rule based multi-agent control algorithm and its implementation using autonomous mobile robots|Recently, many researchers have paid attention to researches on flock behavior in multi-robot system. In most of those researches, an absolute coordinate system is used for identifying a position of each agent consists a flock. It is costly to obtain the position in the absolute coordinates under practical applications because special devices, such as GPS, are necessary. Therefore we have developed an effective simple rule based multi-agent control algorithm for practical uses, which uses limited local information surrounding an agent instead of the absolute coordinates to obtain the situations. In this paper, we implement the algorithm into an autonomous mobile robot. The performance of the proposed algorithm was investigated by experiments using autonomous mobile robots having the proposed algorism. Three situations were examined: 1) guided running according to an external operator';s command, 2) obstacle avoidance, and 3) adaptive cruse by changing a flock formation according to a bottleneck path. In all situations, robots move maintaining a flock form. The validity of the proposed algorithm is discussed through the experimental results.

How to allocate these resources efficiently is critical in proceeding of cooperation and competition. This paper advances and investigates a mathematically computable approach to solve the problems by introducing auction theory. An agent-based multi-item auction model is studied as negotiation method so as to get some precious resources for buyer agents and allocate them for vendor agents.

All this is beneficial for the future mechanisms design both in agent-based software engineering and various distributed system, especially Internet-based commerce applications.

Maoudj|Multi-agent approach for task allocation and scheduling in cooperative heterogeneous multi-robot team: Simulation results|The paper presents a new approach for robots tasks allocation and scheduling in order to minimize the total execution time (makespan) of a mission while satisfying all the tasks constraints. This approach is implemented in a multi-agent architecture for remote control of heterogeneous multi-robot systems. The agents controlling the robots coordinate their actions and cooperate to achieve the assigned mission. The proposed approach is carried out in two phases. During the first phase, a negotiation process (based on the Contract-net protocol) is carried out between the agents of the system to allocate the tasks to the robot proposing the minimal execution time (cost). In the second phase, a local scheduling process based on priority rules is carried out by the corresponding agent for each allocated task in order to minimize its inoccupation (idle) time.

This article uses a directed graph to describe and the direction of information exchange between agents and targets. For continuous-time systems, an enclosing control algorithm is proposed, which does not need to preset the desired formation. The state transfer equation is used to transform the solution of the system into a matrix function of first-order linear constant-coefficient non-homogeneous differential equations. By analyzing the convergence of the solution, the value range of the gain parameter is obtained, and the requirements of topology are proposed. Then the discrete protocol is applied to the discrete-time system. Based on the Schur stability analysis of the system, the requirements of topology and parameter for the system to achieve enclosing control are given. Finally, the self-designed multi-agent platform is introduced, and simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the protocol.

Takahashi|Multi-module learning system for behavior acquisition in multi-agent environment|The conventional reinforcement learning approaches have difficulties in handling the policy alternation of the opponents because it may cause dynamic changes of state transition probabilities of which stability is necessary for the learning to converge. A multiple learning module approach would provide one solution for this problem. If we can assign multiple learning modules to different situations in which each of the module can regard the state transition probabilities as consistent, then the system would provide reasonable performance. This paper presents a method of multi-module reinforcement learning in a multi-agent environment, by which the learning agent can adapt its behaviors to the situations as results of the other agent';s behaviors. We show a preliminary result of a simple soccer situation.

80|6896793|Conference Paper|2014|Cheng Song|Optimal deployment of heterogeneous mobile agents on a circle|In this paper optimal deployment of a network of mobile agents with different maximum traveling speed is considered, where the agents are constrained to move on a circle. The goal is to drive the multi-agent network to final configurations such that the shortest arrival time from the mobile agents to any point on the circle is minimized. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimal network configuration is firstly given. Then, distributed control laws are developed to drive the mobile agents to the optimal configuration. Finally, the results are extended to the case of mobile agents with identical maximum speed. A simulation example is also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
80|7779615|Conference Paper|2016|Daniil Panasetsky|Decentralized multi-agent algorithm for voltage control|In recent years, due to liberalization, power systems are being operated closer and closer to their limits. At the same time, they have increased in size and complexity. Both factors increase the risk of major power outages and blackouts. Most of the existing emergency control ideologies use two approaches: control in case of accidental disturbance and control in case of a parameter deviation. In the existing control ideology there is a lack of procedures that would provide a smooth transition from operational to the effective emergency control, as well as a lack of algorithms that would increase the fault tolerance and adaptability of the local control. This article describes the development and testing a decentralized multi-agent algorithm for voltage stability control which aims to reduce the existing shortcomings.
80|7170758|Conference Paper|2015|Kshitij Jerath|Identification of locally influential agents in self-organizing multi-agent systems|Current research methods directed towards measuring the influence of specific agents on the dynamics of a large-scale multi-agent system (MAS) rely largely on the notion of controllability of the full-order system, or on the comparison of agent dynamics via a user-defined macroscopic system property. However, it is known that several large-scale multi-agent systems tend to self-organize, and their dynamics often reside on a low-dimensional manifold. The proposed framework uses this fact to measure an agent';s influence on the macroscopic dynamics. First, the minimum embedding dimension that can encapsulate the low-dimensional manifold associated with the self-organized dynamics is identified using a modification of the method of false neighbors. Second, the full-order dynamics are projected onto the local low-dimensional manifold using Krylov subspace-inspired model order reduction techniques. Finally, an existing controllability-based metric is applied to the local reduced-order representation to measure an agent';s influence on the self-organized dynamics. With this technique, one can identify regions of the state space where an agent has significant local influence on the dynamics of the self-organizing MAS. The proposed technique is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of vehicle cluster formation in traffic, a prototypical self-organizing system. As a result, it is now possible to identify regions of the roadway where an individual driver has the ability to influence the dynamics of a self-organized traffic jam.

80|972951|Conference Paper|2001|D. Camacho|Information classification using fuzzy knowledge based agents|It is possible to find any kind of useful information in the Web. However, there are serious problems in retrieving, managing and using this information, due to its vastness. Different approaches have been developed to avoid those problems (search engines, metasearch engines, spiders, softbots, intelligent agents or Web agents). This paper is based on one of these systems which uses a set of heterogeneous intelligent software agents to achieve these previous tasks. Two different agents compose the system: Web agents developed to retrieve information from a specific Web source and meta Web agents developed to select the appropriated Web agent to search the necessary information. Each Web agent retrieves, filters and stores the information from the Web to improve system performance. The meta Web agents need to represent and classify the behavior of different Web agents. In this work a fuzzy system that helps to classify the behavior of the Web agents is presented. The meta Web agent calculates the appropriateness of existing agent behavior, using different distances that are analyzed in the paper. The behavior classification is used to decide which Web agent is requested for information by the meta Web agent.
80|8109290|Conference Paper|2017|Camille Barnier|Toward an Embedded Multi-agent System Methodology and Positioning on Testing|Like all systems, multi-agent systems need to be verified during the design cycle. But the test of multi-agent systems is more diffi-cult than the test of classic software. Indeed, it implies to test more than agent functionalities: individual agent behavior, inter-action between agents and global system need to be tested. Sever-al testing methods compensate these difficulties, but do not cover all the aspects of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we compare software testing and multi-agent systems testing and particularly in embedded context. Then major multi-agent system testing techniques are analyzed, with the AEIO facets for multi-agent systems. Finally, we propose a strategy to conduct the testing activity for embedded MAS.
80|5749340|Conference Paper|2011|Ricardo Serrato Barrera|Design patterns in multi-agent system simulation|Building system software is hard. It is necessary to have a methodology to achieve good systems. Presently, there are a few methods for developing multi-agent-based systems. Taking experience of solutions that worked well in the past is the main purpose of the design patterns, which were found in designing object-oriented software. In this work, we present three design patterns that could be used for developing multi-agent-based systems. We made a high level design using these patterns and the design was applied to an emergency evacuation system. We measured the flexibility and extensibility of the design using the instability and abstraction metrics.

80|884152|Conference Paper|2000|K.J. Mackin|Unsupervised training of multiobjective agent communication using genetic programming|Multiagent systems, in which independent software agents interact with each other to achieve common goals, complete distributed tasks concurrently under autonomous control. Agent communication has been shown to be an important factor in coordinating efficient group behavior in agents. Most research on training or evolving group behavior in multiagent systems used predefined agent communication protocols. Designing agent communication becomes a complex problem in dynamic and large-scale systems. The problem is further complicated in a multiobjective scenario. In order to solve this problem, in our previous research we had proposed a method applying genetic programming techniques, in particular automatically defined function genetic programming (ADF-GP), to allow agents to autonomously learn effective agent communication messaging. For this research we take this approach further and combine multiobjective genetic programming in order to adapt the system to a multiobjective environment. In the proposed method separate agent communication protocols are trained for each objective. A software simulation of a multiagent transaction system is used to observe the effectiveness of the proposed method in multiobjective environments.
80|8619540|Conference Paper|2018|Yang Xu|Affine Formation Maneuver Control of Linear Multi-Agent Systems with Undirected Interaction Graphs|The affine formation maneuver control problem of leader-follower linear multi-agent systems with undirected interaction graphs is studied in this paper. First, this paper provides and proves the sufficient and necessary conditions for affine localizability. If given a d-dimensional nominal formation with no fewer than d+ 1 leaders and generic universal rigidity, then any formation shape satisfying affine transformation can be obtained in arbitrary dimension only by these leaders. In the sequel, a novel distributed control method for the followers with linear dynamic models is designed to achieve the desired time-varying maneuvers, and the stability is proved. Simulations are carried out to verify the theoretical results, which show that these followers can track the time-varying references continuously and accurately.

We use this case study to explain the components within a SED and the process to build a SED. A unified and simple model directory is used to describe the life cycle of a system and a goal model to describe the meaning among system artefacts. Developers can not only get all necessary information ranging from high level system requirements to low level source code from the model, but also can understand semantic connections between system artefacts. Different versions of a system can be recorded easily in the structure. We believe the structure has potential for further speeding up and automating the process of system evolution. All in all, the structure complements current agent-oriented methodologies.
80|9258940|Early Access Article|2020|Liqi Wang|Adaptive fuzzy consensus tracking control for uncertain fractional-order multi-agent systems with event-triggered input|This paper focuses on the problem of adaptive fuzzy consensus tracking control with event-triggered input for a class of fractional-order multi-agent systems (FOMASs), where systems are considered to be with unmeasurable states, mismatched uncertain external disturbances and unknown nonlinearities. An event-triggered mechanism with a decreasing threshold function is proposed in this paper, which mitigates communication burden and avoids large control impulse. To achieve better tracking performance in distributed control strategy, a compensating fractional-order adaptation law associated with consensus tracking error is introduced when agents can not obtain the information of reference trajectory directly. Under the fractional-order stability theory, a novel distributed adaptive event-triggered controller with fuzzy observers is constructed, which ensures the boundedness of tracking errors. A simulation example demonstrates the correctness of the presented scheme.
80|7379132|Conference Paper|2015|Abdur Rahman|Towards accelerated agent-based crowd simulation for Hajj and Umrah|There are many scientific applications ranging from weather prediction to oil and gas exploration that requires high-performance computing. It aids industries and researchers to enrich further their advancements. With the advent of general purpose computing over GPUs, most of the applications above are shifting towards High-Performance Computing (HPC). Agent-based crowd simulation is one of the candidates that requires high-performance computing. This type of application is used to predict crowd movement in highly congested areas. One of the most crucial scenarios in which this application can be used is to mimic the movement of the multi-cultural crowd performing Hajj and Umrah in Masjid Al-Haram, Makkah. Adequate performance for an agent-based crowd system is a common problem in computer science. While the existing event planning software, specifically for Hajj and Umrah, are unable to provide the required performance. The main reason is the increasing amount of autonomous pilgrims every year. In this paper, we propose a high performance agent-based crowd simulation that represents pilgrim movement during these rituals. The performance is achieved by parallelizing an open source steering library called OpenSteer using CUDA over GPU. By using our technique, event organizers will be able to simulate large crowds and will also be able to predict whether the developed event plan is viable or not. We have also discussed the architecture and implementation of this parallel Hajj simulation.

80|6859500|Conference Paper|2014|Seyed Mehran Dibaji|Resilient consensus of double-integrator multi-agent systems|We propose an algorithm for consensus of second-order sampled-data multi-agent systems in the presence of misbehaving agents. Each normal agent updates its values (position and velocity) following a predetermined control law based on local information obtained through directed interaction while some malicious agents make updates arbitrarily. The normal agents do not know the global topology of the network, but have prior knowledge on the maximum number of malicious ones. Under the assumption that the network topology has sufficient connectivity in terms of robustness, we develop a resilient algorithm where each agent ignores the neighbors which have large and small position values to avoid being influenced by the malicious agents. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a numerical example.

All the agents are described by FO pure-feedback nonlinear systems. This is more general than the existing works, which only considered strict-feedback or integer-order nonlinear systems. Meanwhile, asynchronous switching are considered in FO MAS, meaning the agents have heterogeneous switching dynamics. A new neural network based adaptive controller is proposed for the considered FO MAS, which can make the consensus tracking error converge to a small neighborhood of origin. Simulation verifies the results obtained.

81|6497512|Journal Article|2013|Tengfei Liu|Distributed Output-Feedback Control of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems|This technical note presents a cyclic-small-gain approach to distributed output-feedback control of nonlinear multi-agent systems. Through novel distributed observer and control law designs, the closed-loop multi-agent system is transformed into a large-scale system composed of input-to-output stable (IOS) subsystems, the IOS gains of which can be appropriately designed. By guaranteeing the IOS of the closed-loop multi-agent system with the recently developed cyclic-small-gain theorem, the outputs of the controlled agents can be driven to within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the desired agreement value under bounded external disturbances. Moreover, if the system is disturbance-free, then asymptotic convergence can be achieved. Interestingly, the closed-loop distributed system is also robust to bounded time-delays of exchanged information.

81|7554594|Conference Paper|2016|Pengxiao Zhang|Observer based event-triggered leader-follower consensus of multi-agent systems|Event-triggered control strategy is an effective method in multi-agent systems with limited resources. In this paper, a consensus tracking problem of leader-follower multi-agent systems via observer-based event-triggered control is studied. In our set-up, only a subset of the followers can obtain some relative information on the leader. Assume that the leader';s control input is unknown for the followers. In order to track such a leader, we design an observer for each follower to estimate the leader';s control input, and then propose an observer-based event-triggered control strategy, in which each agent is allowed to be triggered only at its own triggering time instants. It is proved that under the proposed control strategy, the tracking problem can be solved if the communication graph of the agents is connected and the Zeno-behavior of triggering time sequences can be avoided. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

81|8982117|Conference Paper|2019|Noor Cholis Basjaruddin|Multi Agent Protocol for Cooperative Rear-end Collision Avoidance System|The development of communication between vehicles allows the development of a safety system based on cooperation. Through the cooperation of one vehicle with another vehicle will work together to improve the level of traffic safety. On toll roads, high-speed and sequential vehicles have the potential to experience rear-end collisions and multi-vehicle collision (pileup). Delay in braking from vehicles behind a vehicle that brakes suddenly is the main cause of a multi-vehicle collision. The braking delay is greater if the vehicle is further away from the vehicle which is the cause of a multi-vehicle collision. Through V2V communication, braking by a vehicle can be notified to other vehicles far behind it. This will speed up the braking response so that multi-vehicle collision can be avoided or reduced impact. Devices used to avoid rear-end or multi-vehicle collision in a cooperative manner are recognized as Cooperative Rear-end Collision Avoidance System (CRCAS). The device is part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and is a refinement of RCAS. This study discusses the protocol used by vehicles to communicate with each other and cooperate to avoid a rear-end or multi-vehicle collision.

The character agents use eye movement information to facilitate empathy-relevant reasoning and behavior. Eye Information is used to monitor user';s attention and interests, to personalize the agent behaviors, and for exchanging information of different learners. The system reacts to multiple users'; eye information in real-time and the empathic character agents owned by each learner exchange learner';s information to help to form the online learning community. Based on these measures, the interface infers the focus of attention of the learner and responds accordingly with affective and instructional behaviors. The paper also reports on some preliminary usability test results concerning how users respond to the empathic functions and interact with other learners using the character agents

81|6084048|Conference Paper|2011|Won-jun Hong|Learning by multiple human agents to perform a cooperative control task|Little has been known about the process of learning in a human population during continuous goal-directed tasks. Most models of human-like decision-making based multi-agent systems have been focused on learning by discrete feedback. Also, the multi-agent systems in engineering seldom involve the cognitive concept. In this study, we design a multi-agent system based task in which a group of persons controls a common actuator (i.e. a computer cursor) to achieve the task goal (i.e. target acquisition). The cursor movement provides human agents real-time visual feedback. Each subject is given the control capability of a specific cursor direction that is not informed a priori. The population vector, which has been developed to relate a population of motor neurons to arm direction, is used to drive the cursor movement. Learning occurs in the group of human agents as each agent becomes aware of their contributions (i.e. their controlling directions) to achieving the task goal, leveraging only continuous visual feedback of cursor position on the screen. Moreover, the system level learning is exhibited even though some agents failed to learn their true directions with high accuracy. The experimental results show that the multiple human agents can learn to gain the control of a cursor based on visual feedbacks. In addition, we examine how the learning occurs in the individual level and the collective level.

The communication topology among the agents is directed and exist one leader that has a directed path to each follower at least. The system considered in this paper is consist of unstructured uncertainties, unknown control direction, and actuator faults. The fuzzy logic system is used for approach unknown nonlinear function, the problem of unknown control direction can be solved by using Nussbaum gain function. Based on backstepping design principle and the dynamic surface control technique, a fault-tolerant containment control scheme is developed. By using Lyapunov function stability theory, the proposed FTC controller can guarantee that all signals in all subsystems are bounded, and the tracking errors for each subsystem converge to a small neighborhood of zero.

81|6030013|Conference Paper|2010|Marcelo Cardoso Silva|A Multi-agent System for Dynamic Path Planning|Escape route planning in emergency situations generates interest among researches in many different areas. Computer Science contributes to this by developing simulations of real world situations. An escape route can be regarded as a weighted graph where the labels associated with its edges are determined by the distance between two connected vertexes. Hence, given a starting vertex, it is possible to obtain the minimum path to one exit in the environment. Classical algorithms, such as Dijkstra';s, can solve this problem. However, when the environment changes in real time, this class of algorithms is not efficient. Using Multi-agent Systems to solve this problem dynamically seems to be a good approach to plan escape routes in real time, given new information about the environment when modification are detected. This research exposes this approach, implementing a multi agent communication system in a 3D virtual environment.
81|6498551|Conference Paper|2013|Peter Lavin|Dynamic Proliferation of Agents in a Multiple-Agent System|This paper describes developments in an already existing software agent technology which facilitates agent creation and configuration in relatively large numbers for the formation of a multiple-agent system or MAS. The work addresses the task of quick and easy proliferation of such an MAS in which agents can be added, removed, configured and reconfigured without impacting on other agents. Specification of the MAS is laid down in a number of machine-readable text files, on which a program or script executes to bring the system into being. The mechanism described here is simply a means to creating such an MAS and focuses on scalability and ease of specification and configuration. The agent software used is of modular design and has several internal features which are further exploited to allow these developments. In this work, the agents are hosted in standard web service containers and use network protocols for communications. The original architecture and features of the agents are preserved. Multiple technologies are brought together and tested in the successful creation of a 100 agents.

Varying levels of DR and VVC for the AEP feeder with different load types show that integration of DR and VVC in real time can yield considerable demand reduction by the combined effects of bus voltage reduction, demand curtailment and demand redistribution over time.

81|6049008|Conference Paper|2011|Ravi Kumar|A new multi agent based PSO approaches for optimal power flows with security constraints using different cost functions|This paper proposes new evolutionary multi agent based particle swarm optimization algorithms for solving optimal power flows with security constraints(line flows and bus voltages). These methods combines the multi agents in two dimensional and cubic lattice structures with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form two new algorithms. In Cubic lattice structured multi agent based PSO(CLSMAPSO), an agent represents a particle in cubic lattice structure to PSO, and a candidate solution to the OPF problem. In Two dimensional lattice structured multi agent based PSO(TDLSMAPSO), an agent represents a particle in square lattice structure to PSO, and a candidate solution to the OPF problem. All agents live in a cubic and square lattice like environments, with agents fixed on a lattice point in the ascending order of their fitness value. In order to obtain the optimal solution, each agent in cubic and square lattice competes and cooperates with its neighbor. Making use of these agent-agent interactions, CLSMAPSO and TDLSMAPSO realizes the purpose of minimizing the objective function value. In this paper, Variable constriction factor has been considered for TDLSMAPSO and CLSMAPSO. The OPF problem has been considered with three different cost functions to realize Optimal Power Flow using CLSMAPSO and TDLSMAPSO applied to IEEE 30 bus system. Simulation results show that proposed approaches gives better solution than earlier reported approaches in very quick time.

It has become the mainstream trading methods in consumer to consumer (C2C), such as eBay. The steady collaboration field and common concept of exchange may be formed in the cooperation of the Multi-Agent system(MAS), then the agents will have so much common knowledge in order to complete the tasks. The member of MAS has both cooperation and self-interest. Based on the analysis of the cooperation and competition of the participators in the online auction, the concept of overtime and history information is introduced. As existing incomplete information, the efficiency of the auction is low without consider the history information. This paper put forward a MAS flow frame and negotiation algorithms that make the bidders of the auction participate in the negotiation honestly and actively. Both the efficiency and transparency among the participators have been enhanced.

Then, simple LMI conditions are given to design the controller. A simulation example is given to illustrate the obtained results.
82|9609637|Early Access Article|2021|Wangli He|Secure Control of Multi-Agent Systems Against Malicious Attacks: A Brief Survey|Multi-agent systems (MASs) provide an effective means for coordinating a large number of spatially distributed and networked agents (or nodes, subsystems) such that the desired cooperative tasks can be accomplished with promising reliability, manipulability, scalability, and efficiency. One core issue in the study of MASs is the distributed control protocol design that depends on the local and real-time information exchanges among interacting agents over networks to achieve the anticipated cooperative control objectives. However, network-enabled information sharing and increasing connectivity in practical MASs present several attack factors for malicious adversaries, thereby rendering secure control of MASs fundamentally significant. This paper provides a brief survey of systems and control technologies that have been available for addressing various secure control problems of MASs in the face of various malicious attacks. First, system models that have been commonly adopted to achieve the distributed cooperative control design of MASs are outlined. Second, attacks are classified based on different configuration layers. Then, the existing attack models and countermeasures on communication layer and agent layer are systematically examined, respectively. Also the secure control methods for MASs that have been adequately employed to handle these attacks are surveyed. Finally, several challenging issues are envisioned for potential future research.
82|8865141|Conference Paper|2019|Qishu Bai|Decentralized Event-triggered Communication for Consensus of Uncertain Multi-agent Systems|This paper proposes a novel decentralized event-triggered algorithm for consensus of uncertain multi-agent system under an undirected graph. The event-triggered controller does not rely on continuous communication among agents. Each agent only needs to monitor its own state continuously to determine when to trigger an event and broadcast its states to its neighbors. We show that, under the proposed algorithm, events cannot be triggered an infinite number of times in any finite period (i.e.no Zeno behavior). Simulation results are given to illustrate the theoretical analysis and show the advantages of the event-triggered controllers proposed in this paper.

The agents of the multi-agent system are modeled as double integrator. The communication topology is represented by a fixed and weakly connected digraph. The controller works in conjugation with an estimator to help the agents track the desired trajectory. We present the design of two different estimators, each of which compensate for the delayed input. The first estimator model is designed as a double integrator. We find a condition on the estimator gain such that the controller can achieve trajectory tracking in the presence of constant input delay. The second estimator model is designed as a pair of single integrators. Here, we find conditions on the gains of the estimator model so as to achieve trajectory tracking in the presence of delay. The stability of the system is analysed using the frequency response approach. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

82|8483534|Conference Paper|2018|Wei Chen|Resilient Containment Control for Multi-agent Systems with Packet Dropouts|This paper is concerned with the resilient containment control for discrete-time multi-agent systems subject to packet dropouts. Based on relative measurement outputs, the purpose of this paper is to design an output-feedback controller such that all followers converge into the convex hull spanned by leaders in mean-square sense. First, with the help of the property of the Laplacian matrix, the containment control problem is transformed to an easy to analyze form. Then, sufficient conditions with the form of matrix inequalities are derived to guarantee the desired containment in mean-square sense. Further, by introducing a free matrix combined with an orthogonal basis of the null space of matrix, the controller gain can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the established results.

Furthermore, the Zeno-like behavior for triggering time sequence is excluded. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed event-based control strategy.
82|6682517|Conference Paper|2013|Sk Razibul Islam|A decentralized multi-agent based voltage control for catastrophic disturbances in a power system|In this paper, a multi-agent based voltage and reactive power control in the case of a multiple contingency is presented. Incorporating the agent based autonomous feature to the intelligence of the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), the present power system control structure can be used to help in preventing system voltage collapse during catastrophic disturbances. The control algorithm is based on a decentralized architecture of intelligent agents and the determination of a local zone that can carry out quick countermeasures in a decentralized manner as a multi-agent system (MAS) during an emergency situation. An adaptive determination of the local zones undergoing voltage collapse has been developed based on the electrical distances among the generators and loads. Once assigned, the elements of the Jacobian matrix can be used to determine the optimum actions that need to be carried out at each power system element (such as increasing the voltages of generators and load shedding) within the assigned local zone. The contract-net-protocol (CNP) is used for agent interactions. Simulation results using IEEE-57 bus system show that the proposed method can act quickly to respond to emergency conditions to ensure that voltage collapse can be avoided.

Furthermore, we obtain some initial conditions to ensure the consistent case. Finally, when the convex set reduces into the origin we provide modulus consensus results and then give estimation when agents are disturbed with bounded uncertainties.

In order to take the full advantages of the formation of multi-agent system in expanding the detection range, obtaining complete environmental information, reducing mutual blockage between agents and performing different types of tasks, we combine leader-follower method and artificial potential field method to control multiple agents and achieve ergodic exploration in formation. To avoid collision between agents and obstacles, a family of vector fields are designed around obstacles so that agents can bypass obstacles. Combining the vector field with the path planning of formation traversal, agents can traverse a given area with obstacles and avoid collide with obstacles.

Lakshminarayanan|Novel communication architecture for Multi-Agent Systems in autonomous Microgrid|Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture is a widely investigated topic for application in distributed control for power system operations. The key quality of MAS is its communication which must be versatile for any MAS based control. In this paper, a new communication algorithm for MAS based on Peer to Peer (P2P) communication agreeing to FIPA (Foundation of Intelligent Physical Agents) specifications is proposed. The proposed scheme has reduced communication steps, reduced burden on agents, and has very fast response compared to other existing P2P and Non-P2P architectures. This scheme is applied for a classic economic dispatch problem based on gradient search optimization and the simulation results are presented.

Event-triggered sampling control strategies are designed to reduce the frequency of actuator updating for agents with limited energies when their measurement error exceeds a threshold. For the case of fixed topology, a necessary and sufficient condition is proposed based on Hurwitz stability theory to solve the tracking control bounded consensus problem under the assumption that the topology has a directed spanning tree rooted at the leader. For the case of switching topologies, a sufficient condition on asymptotic stability of the multi-agent system is presented by constructing a Lyapunov function under the assumption that each possible topology contains a directed spanning tree. Finally, numeral examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of these results.
82|7920382|Journal Article|2017|Xiaohua Ge|Distributed Formation Control of Networked Multi-Agent Systems Using a Dynamic Event-Triggered Communication Mechanism|This paper addresses the distributed formation control problem of a networked multi-agent system (MAS) subject to limited communication resources. First, a dynamic event-triggered communication mechanism (DECM) is developed to schedule inter-agent communication such that some unnecessary data exchanges among agents can be reduced so as to achieve better resource efficiency. Different from most of the existing event-triggered communication mechanisms, wherein threshold parameters are fixed all the time, the threshold parameter in the developed event triggering condition is dynamically adjustable in accordance with a dynamic rule. It is numerically shown that the proposed DECM can achieve a better tradeoff between reducing inter-agent communication frequency and preserving an expected formation than some existing ones. Second, an event-triggered formation protocol is delicately proposed by using only locally triggered sampled data in a distributed manner. Based on the formation protocol, it is shown that the state formation control problem is cast into an asymptotic stability problem of a reduced-order closed-loop system. Then, criteria for designing desired formation protocol and communication mechanism are derived. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a comparative study in multirobot formation control.

To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel dynamic compensator based distributed controller. Moreover, the proposed controller is applied to cooperative control of a group of Lorenz systems to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Zoka|An optimal decentralized control for voltage control devices by means of a multi-agent system|Increased penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation is expected in Japan in the near future; thus a new voltage control scheme is required in order to improve the operation of distribution networks. We propose a new voltage control scheme for distribution networks based on a multi-agent system, in which large voltage fluctuations caused by PV generations are effectively regulated by controlling the conventional types of tap-changing controllers. We achieved an optimal control performance by developing an optimal control law that is applicable to decentralized autonomous control. The autonomy is accomplished by using a multi-agent system instead of the centralized control scheme. The proposed method can be applied to general distribution network but effective approximations have been made to achieve high computation efficiency for popular radial networks. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations with successful results.

82|9544063|Early Access Article|2021|Wei Pan|A Dynamically Adaptive Approach to Reducing Strategic Interference for Multi-agent Systems|Multi-agent reinforcement learning is widely used and can successfully solve many problems in the real world. In the multi-agent reinforcement learning system, a global critic network is used to guide each agent‚Äôs strategy to update to learn the most beneficial strategy for the collective. However, the global critic network also makes the current agent‚Äôs learning be affected by other agents‚Äô strategies, which leads to unstable learning. To solve this problem, we propose Dynamic Decomposed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DD-MADDPG): a new network that considers both global and local evaluations and adaptively adjusts the agent‚Äôs attention to the two evaluations. Besides, the use of the experience replay buffer by Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(MADDPG) produces outdated experience, and the outdated strategies of other agents further affect the learning of the current agent. To reduce the influence of other agents‚Äô outdated experience, we propose TDError and Time-based experience sampling (T2-PER) based on DD-MADDPG. We evaluate the proposed algorithm‚Äôs performance according to the learning stability and the average return obtained by the agents. We have conducted experiments in the MPE environment. The results show that the proposed method has better stability and higher learning efficiency than MADDPG and has a certain generalization ability.
83|7805101|Conference Paper|2016|Abderrahim El Mhouti|Towards a collaborative e-learning platform based on a multi-agents system|Today, e-learning is one of the most popular teaching methods. One of its modes is the collaborative learning, where learners can collaborate with their peers, share ideas, and where everyone should be involved in the social interaction. However, the efficiency of collaborative learning depends on the motivation of its members to collaborate, their skills and the quality of tools used to encourage learners to participate actively to exchange knowledge. In this sense, the intelligent agent paradigm, which originates from the computational intelligence field, gained a tremendous interest in its application in collaborative e-learning. This research work focuses on the use of intelligent agents in the sphere of e-learning to encourage collaborative learning. Intelligent agents can be used to assist teachers and tutors by permitting them to track the progress of learners and accordingly recommend the best matching helpers for collaboration. The paper introduces a framework of collaborative e-learning environment based on a Multi-Agents System (MAS). The objective is to incorporate the intelligence of the Multi-Agent System to collect information about the learners'; activities and help tutors to exploit these information to promote collaborative learning. Thus, the system integrates seven agents that interact and ensure the following features: 1/ facilitate the task of tutors by allowing them to appreciate learners'; activities and track the progress of learners and their level of collaboration; 2/ avoid the isolation of learners and motivate them; and 3/ encourage collaborative working and the use of collaborative work tools.

A major challenge exists in team overall performance optimization because there are a large number of uncertainties in agents'; complex processes of interactions. In our previous work, we have found that a small change of a parameter may influence the performance significantly. On the other hand, existing researches of large-scale multi-agent coordination algorithm only proved the evidences by simply comparing with the non-intelligent coordination method, where a general simulation platform is required that can abstract the details of environment but is able to simulate the complex coordination activities for each agent. In this paper, we have designed such a general platform for large-scale multi-agent team coordination. This platform is able to simulate a variety of tasks that are imperative to agents'; team coordination. In addition, by varying the setting of giving team coordination parameters as well as loading different coordination strategies, it is capable of simulating and evaluating system performance according to different properties and provides the clue on building optimization algorithms in future.

It is assumed that the network has switching but jointly-connected topologies in the sense that the union of the associated graphs over a certain time interval always has a spanning tree. Under this assumption, a linear sampled measurement output feedback controller is proposed to achieve full state consensus for a sufficiently small sampling period.

Its goal is to turn large and complex systems into small systems that communicate and coordinate with each other and are easy to manage. Cooperative confrontation has been widely used in different fields such as production scheduling and virtual simulation. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the decision model of multi-agent cooperative confrontation. In this paper, with the aid of a multi-agent cooperative confrontation system, the method of Q-Learning algorithm and value function approximation is used to realize the path planning of the agent. We simulated an experiment to show the application effect of reinforcement learning algorithms in path planning, and compared the convergence of MC Control, SARS, and Q-Learning algorithms, which illustrates the advantages of Q-Learning. Then, simulation experiments are performed to show the application effect of the reinforcement learning algorithm combined with the value function approximation in path planning.

The presented model adopts the Bayesian method to evaluate the trust value of each agent. Every agent can implement trust management autonomously. The simulation experiment results prove that the autonomous trust construction is effective.

To track the average value of sensors'; measured values, the proportional-integral consensus tracking algorithms are proposed for first-order and second-order agents, respectively. By using generalized Nyquist stability criterion, sufficient conditions of average-consensus convergence are obtained for the heterogeneous multi-agent systems under a fixed, symmetric and connected topology.

The cooperative tracking problem of high-order multi-agent systems is first transformed to the stabilizing problem of filtered tracking errors dynamic systems, which only depend on the information from neighboring agents. Then, a novel distributed adaptive critic design-based controller is developed for the newly obtained filtered tracking errors dynamic systems. The special local filtered tracking errors and local critic signals are defined for facilitating the implementation of distributed adaptive critic design. Novel distributed weights updating laws for critic neural networks, actor neural networks, and adaptive parameters are proposed. Furthermore, the RISE technique is introduced to suppress the external disturbances and neural network approximation errors. The asymptotical stability of a closed-loop system is demonstrated by using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a simulation example justifying the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is given.
83|1047481|Conference Paper|2002|Chen Yanxia|Research on protective relaying systems based on multi-agent system|Improving selectivity, celerity, sensitivity and reliability is the purpose of research in protection. Although principles and performance of protective relaying have been improved, their operation is still unsatisfied, due to the difficulty in cooperation work. As a branch of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), agent technology has become a hot spot and researches have been done. But the coordination and collaboration of protection has not been well considered in those works. In this paper, agent technology and the up-to-date research works on its application in protection systems are reviewed. The application of agent in protection system is considered in details from three different hierarchies. Then a protection system based on multi-agent system (MAS) is proposed. The characteristics, structure, classification and decision-making process of this system is elaborated. Served as example, two designs are outlined. One is backup over-current relaying for a power line, the other is a grounding fault detector for a substation. Using the Alternative Transients Program (ATP) as the simulation tool, these systems are simulated. The result shows that through the coordination among distributed protection agents, the process of relay tripping and fault detection can be accelerated and the accuracy of grounding fault detection can be improved. Through cooperation and consideration of protection agents based on different principles, the system';s ability of fault-tolerance can be enhanced. Consequently trip failure and malfunction can be avoid effectively and the time for operation can be curtailed effectively. Compared with a conventional protection system, its performance is more satisfactory.
83|8324251|Conference Paper|2017|Hideaki Yajima|Practical formation control of swarm robots using mobile agents|We propose an algorithm for controlling a set of actual swarm robots that compose specific formations. The swarm robots coordinate each other by using network communication, and compose formations such as specific symbols and characters. Our control algorithm achieves the network communication by using mobile software agents, which introduce control programs to each robot that has no initial program. Since the mobile agent can migrate from one robot to other robots through Wi-Fi network, and bring control programs on demand. Therefore we can introduce new control programs to the robots from outside as we want. We have made the mobile agents communicate each other through pheromone. A typical social insect ant uses pheromone as a communication means. In our robot control system, we have implemented ants and pheromones as mobile software agents. An agent called ant agent drives the mobile robot where it resides, and the other agent called pheromone agent guides to where the ant agent drives the robot. Each ant agent has only partial information of the formation. In order to spread the partial information among the neighbor robots, each ant agents generates pheromone agents and sends them to the surrounding robots. Dispatched pheromone agent looks for the ant agent it is assigned to guide through hopping around the robots. Once a pheromone agent has reached the robot with its target ant agent, the ant agent actually drives the robot by following the guidance of the pheromone agent, and composes the objective formation. In our research, we address the problems in implementing the previous naive algorithm using simplified robots, and make the algorithm suitable in the real world. In our practical algorithm, if an ant agent cannot keep driving its robot due to some other robots block its way, the ant agents migrates to the blocking robot to change the robot and makes the ant agent on the blocking robot take its previously driving robot. Then both ant agents resume keeping driving their exchanged robots to the target positions. We have implemented a simulator based on the algorithm and conducted experiments to demonstrate that our robot control system is practically feasible in the real world.

It is shown that the intelligent CAPP based on multi-agent system has good expansibility and reusability, it can adapt to the changes of products and production conditions in the enterprise.
83|9222332|Early Access Article|2020|Faten Khemakhem|Agent-based intelligent decision support systems: a systematic review|Decision-making complexity, in a distributed environment, is due to hard tasks that a system must resolve. This complexity makes researchers focus on looking for solutions to cope with distributed environment problems. Multi-Agent System (MAS) technology is one of several proposed solutions. This technology rose the challenge in decision-making applications. To date, no systematic review has been conducting, to the best of the authors'; knowledge, to give an overview of a multi-agent-based decision-making system in various areas of science or technology. In this study, we review of 58 studies published from 2007 to 2019. The aim of this paper is a critical analysis of recent approaches. We try to survey their impact on practice and research. The analysis of the extracted studies is based on three selection criteria that are defined in the paper. All included studies have analyzed from four different points of view: Theoretical view, Technical view, Agent view, and Application view. Moreover, we adopt the SWOT analysis to evaluate studied approaches. Multi-agent technology is actually in the process of evolution and enhancement with the appearance of new trends in Artificial Intelligence such as Neural Network and Deep Learning. The results of this review show suggestions for further research and practice.
83|8973261|Conference Paper|2019|Amin Kamal Abd Elraheem|Optimization Problem Statement for Power Generation Management and Control in Multi-Agent Microid|The approach for multi-objective optimization problem formalization for multi-agent energy microgrid is proposed. The approach represented in this paper is based on analyzing microgrid objects as distributed agents forming a multi-agent system (MAS). It provides the possibility to evaluate the efficiency of microgrid as a whole, as well as to estimate the functioning operational efficiency for each individual agent. The elaborated scheme also gives the possibility to formalize the process of integrating heterogeneous objective functions, i.e. technical, economic and ecological ones, into certain combined criteria. Considering different efficiency criteria, it has been proposed multi-objective conversion method based on fuzzy logic.
83|5284822|Conference Paper|2009|Hoang Thi Thanh Ha|Towards the Specification of Recursive Multi-agent Systems Using Type Theory|Nowadays software systems are more and more complex. Such systems are composed of many sub-systems, in which each sub-system exists and interacts with other sub-systems. Since a few years, multi-Agent systems (MAS) propose well considered approaches for these kinds of systems. In this paper, we concentrate on recursive MAS which are well adapted to describe complex systems. Up to now, recursive MAS are only specified by informal languages. This paper proposes the use of type theory to specify recursive MAS. This work constitutes a first theoretical step in the elaboration of a generic software tool for reliable design of recursive MAS.
83|1499809|Conference Paper|2005|M. Fisher|Agents out of control? Towards the formal verification of autonomous agent teams|NASA are interested in using intelligent agents in future space missions, for example Mars exploration or deep space missions. Such missions might involve completely autonomous agents, able to direct their own activity, or might involve human-agent (typically human-robot) teams in which the participants work together. However, the dangers of allowing agents to control, even partially, critical aspects of a mission are clear. Software agents, just like any other computer program, need to be verified to ensure they are appropriate for use in mission critical areas. In this talk, we outline some of our ongoing work concerned with verifying, using logical representations of autonomous agents, the behaviour of systems comprising multiple agents. In addition, we indicate the possibilities (and pitfalls) involved in extending this work to more sophisticated human-agent teams.
83|6990249|Conference Paper|2014|El Hassan Et-Tolba|A multi-agent system architecture modeling for smart grid context|This paper presents architecture for smart grid elements and concepts modeling. We choose the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technology, because it meets this new generation network';s requirements and objectives. There is a need of potential redesign and jeopardize of the traditional electrical networks. As several huge blackouts happened this last decade, they are being gradually left in favor of smart grid for more flexibility and network stability. The proposed architecture goes in this context to solve some of these new problematic issues. The adopted modeling strategy is bottom-up approach; we first give a smart appliance model, and then construct the smallest local independent entity model. We afterward use paradigms of agent and object oriented programming which features allow the architecture to be flexible, extensible and scalable. Different models and their scalability are discussed in this paper. The proposed solution will be useful for academic research on smart grid, once it allows its modeling and simulation, performance study and optimization, and therefore can contributes in energy efficiency.
83|9414993|Conference Paper|2021|Yuntao Liu|Global-Localized Agent Graph Convolution for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning|A lot of efforts have been devoted to solving the problem about complex relationship and localized cooperation among a large number of agents in large-scale multi-agent systems. However, global cooperation among all agents is also important while interactions between agents often happen locally. It is a challenging problem to enable agent to learn global and localized cooperate information simultaneously in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we model the global and localized cooperation among agents by global and localized agent graphs and propose a novel graph convolutional reinforcement learning mechanism based on these two graphs which allows each agent to communicate with neighbors and all a-gents to cooperate at the high level. Experiments on the large-scale multi-agent scenarios in StarCraft II show that our pro-posed method gets better performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms and allows agents learning to cooperate efficiently.
83|5717474|Conference Paper|2010|Gerd S. Schmidt|Consensus in bistable and multistable multi-agent systems|Consensus in bistable and multistable multi-agent systems (MAS) is investigated. The considered MAS consists of agents with nonlinear, bistable or multistable dynamics and local coupling. For this MAS, consensus conditions are presented for arbitrary large networks depending on the algebraic connectivity of the underlying graph. In contrast to most publications in the consensus literature, the considered MAS has only a finite number of discrete consensus points instead of a consensus subspace. This introduces a new kind of consensus problem to the literature on MAS. The differences to classical consensus problems are discussed and the main result is illustrated in a simulation example.
83|8755889|Journal Article|2020|Wei Liu|Cooperative Adaptive Output Regulation for Lower Triangular Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Subject to Jointly Connected Switching Networks|The cooperative global robust output regulation problem for multi-agent systems is a generalization of the leader-following consensus problem. The problem has been studied for various multi-agent systems over connected static networks and for some special classes of nonlinear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks. In this paper, we further consider the same problem for a class of heterogeneous lower triangular nonlinear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks. This class of systems is quite general in that it contains inverse dynamics, is of any order, and its subsystems can have different relative degrees. We will integrate the adaptive distributed observer and the distributed internal model approach to come up with a recursive approach to deal with our problem. We will also apply our approach to a leader-following consensus problem for a group of hyperchaotic Lorenz systems.
83|9404295|Journal Article|2021|Ezgi Oral|Consensus Analysis of Wireless Multi-Agent Systems Over Fading Channels|In this letter, the probability of reaching consensus in wireless multi-agent systems (WMASs) is introduced. Starting with the connectivity probability of random graphs, and considering link outages between agents, we obtain the probability expression that a WMAS with N agents reaches consensus. We validate the obtained exact expression via simulation results. Furthermore, we show that the corresponding diversity order is N -1, hence increasing the number of agents will contribute towards the likelihood of consensus, despite the increased communication need between each agent. Finally, we observe that the consensus speed is highly dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level and the number of agents in a WMAS.

The assumption that different intelligent agents can not execute the same actions which obviously does not fit human commonsense understanding of the world has been done away with. Five functions that involved actions are given at length so that we can investigate the relations among agents, actions and states in depth within the context of social law. Two kinds of intentions (individual intention and group intention) have been investigated in the extended cooperation logic.
83|5553940|Conference Paper|2010|Qiang Zhang|Robust adaptive control of coupled stochastic multi-agent systems with unmodeled dynamics|Distributed robust adaptive control is investigated for a class of stochastic multi-agent systems with unknown time-varying structure parameters, unmodeled dynamics, external disturbances, and interactions among agents. The control goal is to make the states of all the agents converge to a desired function of the population state average (PSA). Due to the fact that only local information is available for each agent, the control is distributed. The key techniques adopted here to cope with the uncertainties are normalized projected least mean square algorithm, Nash certainty equivalence principle and certainty equivalence principle, which are used for estimating the unknown time-varying parameters and unknown PSA term, and designing adaptive control, respectively. Under some mild conditions, the stability of the closed-loop system, consistence of the PSA estimate, and robust Nash equilibrium property of the control laws are obtained. A numerical example is given to illustrate the results.
83|7848462|Conference Paper|2016|Mangilal Sharma|Constraint specification in Multi Agent System|Multi-Agent System (MAS) consists of innumerable independent and active units, called agents, which collaborate with each other to attain pre-determined goals or delegated objectives. Agents being uncoupled, scattered, event-driven and self-motivating in nature any MAS is distributed and large scale. Hence the analysis of MAS are intricate and crucial. This work proposes formal analysis method for defining and specifying properties, resources, knowledge and related constraints of an agent in a MAS. Agents need to reason about the interactions through constraints. These constraints needs to be satisfied for invoking an event. Definite templates to exemplify these aspects of MAS are generated for proper analysis. To justify the expressivity of the proposed methodology an illustration have been considered. The proposed approach has been mapped graphically to an extended version of Multi-Agent System Architecture Graph (Ex-MASAG). Lastly, a software tool named draw FAM has been proposed to design the proposed Ex-MASAG.

84|9512081|Journal Article|2021|Chenpeng Yao|Navigation in Multi-Agent System With Side Preference Path Optimizer|Multi-agent path planning aims to find a set of collision-free global path in the joint configuration space to move each agent from the given start states to the goal states and keep the total cost of the path to a minimum. However, the multi-agent systems in the real-world turn out to be a non-communication and partially observable system where the goal states and the planning strategy of other agents are usually unknown. In order to solve the multi-agent path planning problem in a more general environment, a social-aware navigation method is proposed in this paper. By imitating the most basic human road rules, left/right-handed rules, we add side preference to the global path planning by using a path optimizer so that each agent only needs to consider its own planning while the system is approximately optimal. The proposed path optimizer is tested in benchmark maps, robot-robot and robot-human interaction environment, respectively. With the side preference path optimizer, the success rate of multi-agent navigation with 6 agents increase from 0% to 78% at the cost of only extra 0.1 seconds planning time. The proposed method makes the navigation in human-robot interaction scenes become easier.

In this platform, the main control agent organizes agents with various functions and makes them work collaboratively to solve problems through the communication and cooperation mechanism. We use the object-oriented method to manage various kinds of resources in the resource base. In other words, the intelligent system based on agents can effectively solve the semi-structured unstructured problems by ways such as task-sharing and communication cooperation.
84|7379775|Conference Paper|2015|Karandeep Singh Brar|Policy evaluation by analysing population emergent behaviour with a microsimulation and multi agent based model|Maintaining a healthy population with optimal demographic distribution is one of the main stays of an economy. But unfortunately, of late, many developed countries of the world are facing problems of low fertility rate and ageing population. This would eventually have a major impact on the economy. Countries are trying their best to revive the trends and bring back fertility rates to the population sustaining level. But most of these efforts haven';t brought back the desired results and despite efforts, many countries continue to face low fertility rate as well as ageing population. Simulation and modelling are one of the best ways to understand population dynamics. Many models have been prepared but they all lack in generality and purpose. In this paper we present a full scale general purpose model for population dynamics, which would use microsimulation and agent based modelling techniques and would assist the modellers and demographers in understanding population dynamics.

According to the automation level and working mode of each functional agent to finish its tasks in the manufacturing environment, the manufacturing resource agents are divided into three categories. In order to construct these various agents conveniently, a multi-layer structure is put forward. Based on the structure, the agents can not only rapidly deal with unexpected events, but also recognize and predict the environment change automatically to adjust their behavior. A manufacturing system hierarchical architecture based on MAS is also provided. According to the change of actual productive tasks and the difference of scheduling strategies, the manufacturing system can be reconstructed flexibly by changing the MAS structure and the granularity of the agents. Consequently, it can adapt to the rapid change of the manufacturing environment and the manufacturing resources.
84|8865095|Journal Article|2019|Shangfei Zheng|Improved Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Path Planning-Based Crowd Simulation|Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proved to be more suitable than reinforcement learning for path planning in large-scale scenarios. In order to more effectively complete the DRL-based collaborative path planning in crowd evacuation, it is necessary to consider the space expansion problem brought by the increase of the number of agents. In addition, it is often faced with complicated circumstances, such as exit selection and congestion in crowd evacuation. However, few existing works have integrated these two aspects jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a planning approach for crowd evacuation based on the improved DRL algorithm, which will improve evacuation efficiency for large-scale crowd path planning. First, we propose a framework of congestion detection-based multi-agent reinforcement learning, the framework divides the crowd into leaders and followers and simulates leaders with a multi-agent system, it considers the congestion detection area is set up to evaluate the degree of congestion at each exit. Next, under the specification of this framework, we propose the improved Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IMADDPG) algorithm, which adds the mean field network to maximize the returns of other agents, enables all agents to maximize the performance of a collaborative planning task in our training period. Then, we implement the hierarchical path planning method, which upper layer is based on the IMADDPG algorithm to solve the global path, and lower layer uses the reciprocal velocity obstacles method to avoid collisions in crowds. Finally, we simulate the proposed method with the crowd simulation system. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

84|8865495|Conference Paper|2019|Jianglong Yu|Practical adaptive time-varying output formation tracking for high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems using neural networks|Practical adaptive time-varying output formation tracking problems for high-order nonlinear strict-feedback multiagent systems are investigated in this paper. The time-varying output formation tracking requires the followers'; output vectors to track the output vector of the leader while achieving a time-varying formation. The dynamics of the leader and the followers can have uncertain mismatched nonlinearities while the leader';s control input is also unknown. To deal with the mismatched nonlinearities, the backstepping techniques are utilized to construct the protocols. Firstly, visual controllers are designed to overcome the effects of the uncertainties while guaranteeing the stability of each layer. The complicated visual controllers are estimated by the neural networks. A full adaptive protocol is constructed with adaptive gains to avoid using the global information of the interaction topology. Then, an algorithm is presented to design the protocol, whose parameters are much less. Besides, the stability of the algorithm is proved by Lyapunov theories. Finally, simulation results are presented to prove the effectiveness.

84|8028742|Conference Paper|2017|Jianglong Yu|Practical time-varying formation tracking control for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems based on the distributed extend state observer|Practical time-varying formation tracking analysis and design problems for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems are investigated by using a novel distributed extended state observer, where the formation tracking error can be arbitrarily small. Different from the previous work on formation tracking problems, the states of followers form a predefined time-varying formation while tracking the state of the leader with unknown but derivative-bounded control input. Besides, the dynamics of each agent has heterogeneous nonlinearity. Firstly, a novel distributed extended state observer is constructed by using only neighboring relative information, which can process not only the heterogeneous nonlinearity of each follower, but also the unknown control input of the leader. Secondly, a practical time-varying formation tracking control protocol with the distributed extended state observer is proposed. Additionally, the stability of the closed-loop multi-agent system under the protocol is proven by using the Lyapunov theory. Thirdly, an approach is derived to design the control parameters in the practical time-varying formation tracking protocol by solving a linear matrix inequality. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

We argue that the MAS paradigm in combination with rigorous modeling and inference methods can facilitate design of theoretically and technically sound fusion systems. This is illustrated with the help of a MAS approach to Bayesian fusion which supports robust and efficient situation assessment in crisis management settings. However, the MAS paradigm might be ill-suited for certain domains and information fusion theories. In addition, implementation of multi agent fusion systems for real world applications can be theoretically as well as technically very challenging. We identify several research topics which address these challenges.

Its own LAN, CS-LAN, is steadily expanding, becoming very complex and reaching now a spaghetti state. Next April 2011, the department of Computer Science will move to another building on the same campus. We need to design a new LAN to be installed in the future building. It will be provided by new vendors, use new technologies complying with the constraints of the new building. However, our department has no full time network manager, one of our colleague professors working as a network manager on his spare time. Therefore, all the knowledge about the CS-LAN is scattered among users, mainly professors and is not recorded. Indeed, the changes in configuration of the CS-LAN were often reported by e-mail only. In this paper, we try to propose a design plan working with multi agent systems in order to compare the design parts of the new CS-LAN, and capture design and operational knowledge semi-automatically for future use.

To remove the assumption, this paper proposes an event-triggered adaptive distributed observer, which is designed to estimate the system matrix of the exosystem. With the proposed triggering mechanism, each agent only sends the information to its neighbors at its own triggering times. Moreover, by introducing a fixed timer, Zeno behavior can be strictly excluded. The effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered adaptive distributed observer is demonstrated by an example.
84|9457138|Early Access Article|2021|Jiafeng Yu|Event-Triggered Bipartite Consensus for Fuzzy Multi-Agent Systems under Markovian Switching Signed Topology|In this paper, we study the problems of bipartite and cooperative consensus with a strictly dissipative performance for fuzzy multi-agent systems (MASs) in a unified framework. First, we prove that bipartite consensus over a structurally balanced signed graph is equivalent to cooperative consensus over the corresponding unsigned graph by leveraging the gauge transformation for a class of nonlinear MASs. Then, a polynomial fuzzy model is constructed to describe the nonlinear MAS formed by one leader and followers. For mitigating communication and computational load, a mode-dependent eventtriggered transmission strategy is proposed. By establishing the switching topologies through Markovian process, a new sampleddata event-triggered consensus protocol is designed.With a modedependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a novel relaxed dissipative criterion is obtained. The criterion guarantees that all agents can achieve both event-triggered cooperative consensus and event-triggered bipartite consensus with the same magnitude but opposite signs for MASs over structurally balanced signed directed graphs and Markovian switching topologies. Moreover, the event-triggered parameters and consensus control gains can be numerically solved via the sum of squares (SOS) method. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.
84|846389|Conference Paper|2000|D. Ouelhadj|Multi-agent architecture for distributed monitoring in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS)|This paper describes an intelligent distributed monitoring architecture for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) based on the multi-agent paradigm. The proposed approach models the FMS by a society of cognitive agents, which monitor a set of heterogeneous resources. These agents have sufficient knowledge for the decision-making and they co-operate together in order to achieve the FMS monitoring functions. The originality of this approach resides in the total distribution of the monitoring functions over the agents and the co-operation of these agents by the contract net protocol for the real-time supervision. These characteristics improve flexibility, extensibility, real-time running, autonomy, fast reaction to faults, and development cost. Experimental results developed in simulation show the feasibility and the potentialities of the proposed multi-agent architecture for distributed monitoring where concepts such us flexibility, co-ordination, reactivity and integration are involved.

To realize the digital communication between signals and utilize limited communication bandwidth effectively, we introduce the Œ£A quantizer with limited communication data rate (quantization bits) into the control field and for the design of the QILC in this paper. In addition, the packet losses are also first considered into the QILC, which makes the controller more close to the practical engineering applications. Since the nonlinearity and randomness introduced by the quantization and packet losses, a decreasing learning gain is utilized with the help of the non-smooth analysis and mathematical expectation for the analysis of convergence. Accurate tracking in the sense of expectation can be obtained based on randomly small number of quantization bits, even merely one bit of quantization information. Numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

84|885003|Conference Paper|2000|K. Kostiadis|The use of design patterns for the development of multi-agent systems|Developers of AI software are normally faced with design challenges involving robustness, efficiency, and extensibility. Most of these challenges at a higher level are independent of the application-specific requirements. Although design patterns have been successfully adopted to tackle these issues, they are rarely documented. Consequently this knowledge remains hidden in the minds of developers or buried within complex system source code. The primary contribution of the paper is to describe an abstract design methodology that can be applied in many (single or) multi-agent systems. The paper mainly illustrates how design patterns can ease the development and increase the efficiency of such systems. As an example, the Essex Wizards multi-agent system is presented which won the third prize in the RoboCup';99 simulator league competition.

To deal with the unavailable velocity information, we firstly design a high gain observer for each agent to estimate its full state. Then, we use the relative information of observers'; states to design the fully distributed tracking controller for each follower agent. We prove that all the follower agent can tracking the leader agent, and the estimation errors of observers converge to zero asymptotically. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our consensus protocol.
85|1427060|Conference Paper|2005|J. Zinky|Using QoS-adaptive coordination artifacts to increase scalability of communication in distributed multi-agent systems|Coordination artifacts in multi-agent systems (MAS) offer a coherent abstraction of communication among agents. Coordination artifacts are first-class entities that encapsulate the coordination activity outside of the agents themselves. The separation of domain knowledge into agents, and communications knowledge into coordination artifacts, allows the decoupling of processing from coordination. Pulling out coordination allows for adaptation to systemic constraints and changing quality of service (QoS) requirements. Tailoring the QoS-adaptation to the kind of coordination and to the availability of underlying communication resources increases the scale of inter-agent communication, both in terms of the range of communication bandwidths supported and the propagation delays. In this paper, we extend the notion of coordination artifacts to include adaptation to QoS requirements. We illustrate how to construct QoS-adaptive coordination artifacts in an existing MAS infrastructure (Cougaar). Finally we show how coordination artifacts can be used to increase scalability in an agent-based distributed control application.

Nonlinear control and impulsive pinning control protocols are designed to guarantee that follower agents realize consensus with the leader agent in finite time(fixed time). Based on the finite-time and fixed-time consensus theory, stochastic analysis technique, comparison system theory and algebra graph theory, some sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the finite-time and fixed-time consensus of systems. Then, the setting times of finite-time consensus and fixed-time consensus are estimated. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the correctness of our conclusions.

For instance, in the case of multiagent systems, where only relative measurements are available, this is of high relevance. This paper proposes a distributed observer design solution, which is scalable with respect to the number of agents. This distributed observer is then used for the design of a distributed observer-based output synchronization control algorithm. Robust performance against exogenous and measurement disturbances can be guaranteed for both the estimation error and synchronization error.

85|8928944|Journal Article|2020|Junjie Fu|Velocity and Input Constrained Coordination of Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems With Relative Output Information|In this work, we consider the coordination control of second-order multi-agent systems subject to both velocity and input constraints with only relative output information. First, the leaderless consensus problem is considered where a nonlinear distributed controller is proposed which achieves asymptotic consensus of the agents using only local velocity and relative output information. Then, generalization to the leader-following formation control with known leader';s input is studied. For the case of unknown leader';s input, a finite-time observer-based controller is proposed using sliding mode control ideas. Finally, the collision avoidance requirement for the leader-following formation control is handled by employing control barrier functions. Necessary modifications to the nominal formation controllers are obtained by properly formulating some quadratic problems and the velocity and input constraints are met during the entire operation. Several simulation examples are provided to illustrate the developed controllers and the effectiveness of the collision avoidance strategy.
85|5376565|Conference Paper|2009|M. Vigilson Prem|Group Communication Based Approach for Reliable Mobile Agent in Information Retrieval Applications|Mobile agents have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Mobile agents travel through servers to perform their programs. Maintaining mobile agent availability in the presence of agent server‚Äôs crash, during their travel, is a challenging issue, since, developers normally have no control over remote agent servers. In the context of mobile agents, fault tolerance is crucial to enable the integration of mobile agent technology into today‚Äôs business applications. In multi mobile agent deployment, communication among mobile agents is another aspect to concentrate. When it ensures the aliveness of other agents, agent reliability and data availability, there is a need to locate agents to implement the communication aspect. Considering the merits of the existing work, this paper proposes an attempt to improve the agent survivability in the aspect of multiple agent deployment and communication among them for information sharing.

It provides a loose coupled and implementation neutral infrastructure for distributed applications. On the other hand, multi-agent autonomic architectures have evolved to provide self-management in the software system by using specialized reusable software components (agents) acting on behalf of users, devices and applications to provide transparent interfaces between different entities in the environment. In this paper, we propose using agent as Web service with multi-agent autonomic architecture. This would help in providing self-aware, self-manageable, highly available, extremely reliable and mobile Web services known as agent services.

In Morocco, more than 2 million people aged 18 and over are diabetic. In order to diagnose and treat diabetes, early detection is needed. Thus, the aim of this qualitative study was to overcome this difficulty by giving more autonomy and initiative to the different software modules specialized in the medical diagnosis. To enable robust, reliable medical diagnostic support, Multi-Agent System can be the tool for distributed diagnostic.

Then the system aggregates the classifications of these algorithms with a controller agent to increase the accuracy of the classification using a majority vote. In addition, this article discusses the current gap and the challenges of adopting machine learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

This paper presents a new methodology based on Multi-Agent Systems for power distribution network reconfiguration aiming at minimizing power losses based on game theory. The principal characteristic of the game is the interpretation of the payoff matrix as having physical meaning. This way allowed better decisions to be taken in order to improve the overall performance of the network.

85|7379129|Conference Paper|2015|Samsi Md Said|Embedded structural-actuator system for hyper redundant robot serpentine gait modeling|Snake like robot belong to a class of hyper redundant robot which possessing a lot of actuators and transmission subsystem. Normally the transmission subsystem is more bulky than the actuator themselves that increase the overall weight of the snake like robot. A way need to be found in order to convert the structure itself to be actuator and eliminate the bulky transmission system so that the weight can be optimized. This compact actuator-structural concept will allow high number degree of freedom system to be realized. Next, the robot itself needs to be flexible in order to enhance the embedded actuation concept and add the degree of operability of the robot with human interaction environment. This is because rigid robot is quite dangerous to itself and also to environment on impact during their movement. Thus, the main work of this research is to introduce embedded pneumatic muscle module for a system of flexible snake like robot. Compact embedded pneumatic system approach will be adopted in producing this design.

The protocol of group consensus, which defines three kinds of agents respectively named in-group agent,-group agent and pinned agent, is the key issue for global cooperation of all DGs in MMG. The proposed control method presets the pinned consensus values for multiple MGs considering global cooperation and realizes a pinning based group consensus for DGs in each MG. Hence, the MMG can reach a new cooperative stable state where all the MGs achieves its corresponding expectant group consensus. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed control method.

The design method is based on Riccati inequality as well as algebraic graph theory. Finally, two examples are shown to illustrate the performance of the present controller.

We propose two design methods of a dynamic pinning controller with a full order observer and an integrator. One is based on the infinite-horizon linear-quadratic optimization technique. The other is based on the deadbeat control method. It is shown that the convergence becomes better as the overall coupling strength among agents increases. It is shown by simulation that, as the length of the longest path among all paths from the pining agent to the other ones is smaller, the convergence to the desired value becomes better and the overshoot of the pining agent becomes smaller.

Baker|Integrating an Agent-Based Wireless Sensor Network within an Existing Multi-Agent Condition Monitoring System|The use of wireless sensor networks for condition monitoring is gaining ground across all sectors of industry, and while their use for power engineering applications has yet been limited, they represent a viable platform for next-generation substation condition monitoring systems. For engineers to fully benefit from this new approach to condition monitoring, new sensor data must be incorporated into a single integrated system. This paper proposes the integration of an agent-based wireless sensor network with an existing agent-based condition monitoring system. It demonstrates that multi-agent systems can be extended down to the sensor level while considering the reduced energy availability of low-power embedded devices. A novel agent-based approach to data translation is presented, which is demonstrated through two case studies: a lab-based temperature and vibration monitoring system, and a proposal to integrate a wireless sensor network to an existing technology demonstrator deployed in a substation in the UK.

It is shown that high-order consensus may exist in systems with heterogeneous agents. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for the existence of high-order consensus solution to heterogeneous multi-agent systems. The obtained condition shows that for systems with diverse communication delays, high-order consensus does not require each self-delay of agent is equal to the corresponding communication delay. A matching condition for self-delays and communication delays is derived. Finally, when communication delays are unknown, an adaptive adjustment mechanism is proposed for on-line adjusting self-delays.

A new event-based adaptive output consensus tracking scheme is proposed under directed graph condition. To compensate the effects of uncertain external disturbances and event-triggered measurement errors on the close-loop system stability, an additional parameter estimator is introduced in each agent to estimate the unknown lumped parameter consisting of the upper bound of external disturbances and the triggering threshold. Besides, both continuous monitoring of neighbors'; states and the information of global parameters are not needed in designing the triggering mechanism. It is shown that all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded and the desired output consensus tracking can be achieved.

86|8243815|Conference Paper|2017|Zhongmei Wang|Consensus error of the linear multi-agent systems with noises|The consensus error calculation of the multi-agent systems (MASs) with system noises and communication noises is considered in this paper. Each agent is modeled by a continuous-time linear time-invariant dynamics and the communication topology is described by an undirected graph. It is supposed that the agent can obtain its own state accurately and receive the state of the neighbor agent with noisy disturbance. The agent estimates its neighbors'; state based on the noisy measurement receiving from its neighbors. The distributed control protocol is designed by employing the agent';s own state and the estimated state of is neighbor agents. Due to the existence of the system noises, the MASs can not reach consensus. The consensus error will be calculated via a solution of a Lyapunov equation.

In order to save the limited network communication bandwidth of multi-agent systems, event-triggered sampled-data transmission strategy is adopted. Event conditions are designed for both leader and followers to reduce the frequency of state transmission more effectively. According to the event-triggered sampled-data of the leader and followers, bipartite formation controllers are designed for followers. By using the event conditions and the Lyapunov method, the sufficient conditions for the realization of bipartite formation and guaranteed-cost bipartite formation are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequality, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated by numerical examples.

To solve this problem, we propose a distributed linear protocol with rotation matrices representing desired orientation. Then, the multi-agent system can be described as a linear system, whose system matrix contains the information of the interconnection topology and the orientation configuration. By exploring some special properties of the system matrix, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the proposed linear protocol can achieve the modulus consensus. Specially, the modulus consensus under such linear protocol only depend on the initial velocity of each agent. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.
86|4811349|Conference Paper|2008|Jonathan Lee|Dynamic role binding with Agent-centric Contract Net Protocol in agent organizations|As open multi-agents systems are getting increasing attentions in building large-scale software systems, the study on agent organizations - a building block of multi-agents systems, becomes a promising research track. Roles as a first class citizen in agent organizations impose an imperious demand for dealing with the major challenge: how agents bind roles in the formation of agent organizations in which agents can dynamically enter or leave the organizations. This challenge can be further decomposed into four issues: how to discover agents distributed over various organizations, how to select reliable agents to bind roles, how to enable agents to cooperate in roles binding, and how to unbind roles as agents leave an organization. The focus of this paper is on an extension to Contract Net protocol with reputation model to address these four issues related to the life cycle of dynamic role binding, called Agent-centric Contract Net Protocol (ACNP), as a negotiation mechanism that agents can adopt to establish agent organizations at run time through roles binding.
86|6670619|Conference Paper|2013|Juan Ter√°n|Cultural Algorithms-based learning model for multi-agent systems|This paper aims to evaluate the learning model for coordination schemes in multiagent systems (MAS) based on Cultural Algorithms. The model is applied to a case of study in industrial automation, related to the Agents-based System for Fault Management System. The instantiation occurs on the conversations that are defining in the MAS';s coordination model, which are characterized by type of conversation that have been previously defined. A conversation can have sub-conversations, and in this case the sub-conversations are characterized by a particular type of conversation. Additionally in these conversations can occur some type of conflict, that can be solved by using different coordination mechanisms existing in the literature. For this, it is developed a model based on cultural algorithms, which is used by the MAS as a learning way in the process to determine which coordination mechanism is more suitable for a given conversation and a given scenario. The results show that the obtained model through this learning guides the MAS to determine which mechanism is better suited for a given conversation.

86|8484205|Conference Paper|2018|Boker Almuatazbellah|High-Gain Observer-Based Distributed Tracking Control of Heterogeneous Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems|We address the problem of leader-follower tracking control of nonlinear multi-agent systems. The considered heterogeneous models of the agents and the leader are allowed to be uncertain and can accept unknown bounded disturbances. In addition, the leader';s position is only known to its immediate neighbors. Given this setting, a high-gain observer-based output feedback control system is designed that achieves ultimate boundedness of closed-loop system trajectories. Moreover, the ultimate bound can be made arbitrarily small. The output feedback control system can also recover the trajectories of the state feedback control performance when the observer gain be made sufficiently large. The design procedure is demonstrated by a simulation example for a number of interconnected Van der Pol oscillators.

This approach is based on the reuse of previous traces that are similar to the current situation in a dynamic way. Several approaches have been used in this area, but they suffer from some limitations related to real-time dynamic parameters (identify the different situations possible that need to be defined by the designer beforehand). Our approach based Big Data Multi-Agent System and Cloud Computing is able to study dynamic situations (recognition, prediction, and learning situations). We propose a generic approach able to learn automatically from them experiences in order to acquire the knowledge automatically. Based on the Case-Based Reasoning and multi-agent paradigm, we propose a modification of the static CBR cycle in order to introduce a dynamic process of Case-Based Reasoning based on a dynamic similarity measure able to evaluate in real time the similarity between a dynamic situation (target case) and past experiences stored in the memory (sources case) in order to predict the target case in the future.
86|4983383|Magazine Article|2009|Longbing Cao|Agent Mining: The Synergy of Agents and Data Mining|Autonomous agents and multiagent systems (or agents) and data mining and knowledge discovery (or data mining) are two of the most active areas in information technology. Ongoing research has revealed a number of intrinsic challenges and problems facing each area, which can';t be addressed solely within the confines of the respective discipline. A profound insight of bringing these two communities together has unveiled a tremendous potential for new opportunities and wider applications through the synergy of agents and data mining. With increasing interest in this synergy, agent mining is emerging as a new research field studying the interaction and integration of agents and data mining. In this paper, we give an overall perspective of the driving forces, theoretical underpinnings, main research issues, and application domains of this field, while addressing the state-of-the-art of agent mining research and development. Our review is divided into three key research topics: agent-driven data mining, data mining-driven agents, and joint issues in the synergy of agents and data mining. This new and promising field exhibits a great potential for groundbreaking work from foundational, technological and practical perspectives.

A hybrid coverage enhancement system is developed, consisting of two distinctive layers. In network control layer, a link removal algorithm is designed to generate a sparse network structure while preserving the global connectivity. A potential function based motion controller is synthesized in motion control layer to disperse a team of mobile agents while avoiding any inter-agent collisions. The proposed hybrid coverage enhancement system can reconfigure an initially compact multi-agent system to achieve a certain level of coverage with guaranteed connectivity and collision avoidance. Moreover, the proposed method can be used in both two dimensional area coverage enhancement and three dimensional space coverage enhancement.

86|6640632|Conference Paper|2013|Zhijian Ji|Protocol design for network controllability of multiple agents|The paper makes an attempt to unify the design of linear consensus protocol for multi-agent controllability. The problem is studied under leader-follower framework. We first show that protocols can be respectively designed for a high-order and single-integrator multi-agent system under which the controllability is proved to be determined uniquely by topology structure of the communication graph. Then this observation is further proved to be hold for generic system. To this end, an equivalent transformation is introduced and an approach is presented to design protocols for the controllability of generic system. Finally the controllability is evaluated in a unified way with respect to the dimension of system, the network topology structure and the design of protocols, which reveals that controllability can be regarded to a certain degree as an intrinsic property of multi-agent systems. It is also proved that the controllability is equivalent to that of a simplified subgraph of the original communication graph.

The growing importance of such novel networked cyber-physical context demands suitable and effective computing paradigms to fulfill the various requirements of IoT systems engineering. In this paper, we propose to explore an agent-based computing paradigm to support IoT systems analysis, design, and implementation. The synergic meeting of agents with IoT makes it possible to develop smart and dynamic IoT systems of diverse scales. Our agent-oriented approach is specifically based on the agent-based cooperating smart object (ACOSO) methodology and on the related ACOSO middleware: they provide effective agent design and programming models along with efficient tools for the actual construction of an IoT system in terms of a multiagent system. A case study concerning the development of a complex IoT system, namely a Smart University Campus, is described to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
86|1343000|Conference Paper|2004|Xin Li|Learning how to plan and instantiate a plan in multi-agent coalition|We propose an innovative two-step learning approach to planning-instantiation for multi-agent coalition formation in dynamic, uncertain, real-time, and noisy environments. The first step learns about the planning of a coalition to improve its quality, adapting to the real-time and environmental requirements. The second step learns about the instantiation of the plan to improve the formation process, taking into account uncertain and dynamic behaviors of the peer agents. Decomposing the approach into two steps allows for modularity and flexibility in learning: learning how to plan a coalition is strategic while learning how to instantiate a plan is tactical. Our approach employs a case-based reinforcement learning (CBRL) framework.
86|8667815|Journal Article|2019|Jiayu Chen|Robust Quantized Consensus of Discrete Multi-Agent Systems in the Input-to-State Sense|In this paper, we consider the quantized consensus problem of multiple discrete-time integrator agents which suffer from additive noise. Due to the limited communication resources, each agent can only exchange quantized information of finite length with its neighbors through unreliable channels, where the transmitted signals may be delayed or even lost. Quantization errors, network delay, and packet loss result in quantization mismatch. To handle the additive noise and quantization mismatch, a quantized consensus protocol is proposed by implementing dynamic encoding and decoding policies at a finite bit rate. Particularly, the proposed consensus protocol introduces an internal saturation function into all the controllers of agents so that the control inputs of neighbor agents can be predicted locally by each agent even under distributed control law and quantization mismatch. Based on such shared control input information, the proposed consensus protocol can guarantee the achievement of the approximate consensus of all agents in the input-to-state sense, i.e., the consensus errors of agents are bounded from above by the sum of a class K
&lt;sub xmlns:mml=&#034;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#034; xmlns:xlink=&#034;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#034;&gt;‚àû&lt;/sub&gt;
 function of the upper bound of the additive noise and a class KL function of the upper bound on the initial states of agents. It is shown that such approximate consensus in the input-to-state sense can be guaranteed at an as low bit rate as 1 bit per time step for each agent without requiring any global information, except an upper bound of the number of agents. Two specific situations, namely packet loss, and network delay, are further analyzed with the explicit expressions of quantization mismatch. The simulations are done to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed quantized consensus protocol.

Firstly, the average bipartite consensus problem is formulated for a high-order multi-agent system. Then, linearly parameterized models are used to describe the unknown dynamics. Simultaneously, adaptive estimation laws are designed for the unknown dynamics and time-varying coupling weights as well.

The convergence of the close-loop multi-agent system under the proposed consensus control is analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical results.

Among the performance improvement, the reduction of electrical losses is an important quality factor which is associated with energy efficiency. This paper presents a method based on Multi-agent Systems (MAS) that manages topology changes by switching operations to improve the system performance in dynamic scenario, where the power demand varies throughout the day. Experiments were performed allocating three different load consumer profiles (residential, commercial, and industrial) in two test systems with 12-bus and 16-bus, creating several scenarios. The agents were deployed in a set of small-sized single-board computers with low computational power to mimic CPS. The simulations has shown the success of the method on managing the decision making among different agents to provide the joint effort to manage the loss reduction on the network.

To guarantee performance requirements, and avoid frequent updates of the sensors, and the controllers at the same time, two independent event-triggered schemes with dynamic threshold are proposed in sensor-to-observer (S-O), and controller-to-actuator (C-A) channels, respectively. And a fully distributed observer event-based controller is designed, which only requires the observer information from neighboring followers, and itself for each follower. With the help of the Riccati equation, and inequality techniques, some simple, and convenient sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the closed loop system converges to a bounded region exponentially. Moreover, the proposed dynamic event-triggered mechanisms in S-O, and C-A channels do not only lessen the transmission load, and controller update, but also exclude the Zeno behavior. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the correctness, and efficiency of our results.

Today, the advantage of using such approaches is well established: genetic algorithms, ant algorithms, artificial immune systems, etc. However, there is no research supporting the integration of these different approaches. In particular, hybrid approaches integrating several bio-inspired analogies at the same time are rare. In this paper, we investigate to which extent it is possible to propose a design approach which can integrate different bio-inspired paradigms. From this perspective, we show the interest of considering the multi-agent paradigm as the common denominator of bio-inspired approaches and we propose a generic agent-based model for bio-inspired systems.

In our recent work, we solved this problem for general higher order systems under two types of communication topologies, represented, respectively, by a fixed strongly connected directed graph and by a switching connected undirected graph. A common Lyapunov function technique is employed to establish the results. In this paper, we solve the problem for a more general communication topology which is represented by a switching strongly-connected directed graph. We construct a sequence of different Lyapunov functions and use them to establish our results. Simulation study verifies the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

It is assumed that a human operator controls the MASs via sending the command signal to a non-autonomous leader which generates the desired trajectory. Moreover, the leader';s input is nonzero and not available to all followers. By using neural networks and fault estimators to approximate unknown nonlinear dynamics and identify the actuator faults, respectively, the neighborhood observer-based neural fault-tolerant controller with dynamic coupling gains is designed. It is proved that the state of each follower can synchronize with the leader';s state under a directed graph and all signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be cooperatively uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results are presented for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Most of the existing approaches concentrate on separating the problem in distinct sub problems and using standard optimization methods on these sub problems while trying to maintain consistency among the variables shared by the sub problems. Basically these methods try to help the user to find an optimization process which reduces the complexity of the problem. However, a shortcoming of these MDO methods is that they require a strong expert knowledge of both the problem to be solved and the method which is applied, in order to obtain interesting results.

An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations. &lt;/para&gt;

87|4523813|Conference Paper|2008|Xiangzhen He|A multi-objective model for transmission network restoration based on multi-agent and Tabu Search|As power system restoration (PSR) is a multi-variable, multi-objective, and multi-constrained nonlinear optimization problem, it is difficult to establish a well-defined mathematical model to reasonably describe it. Given this background, a new distributed model for PSR is proposed in this paper by combining multi-agent technology (MAT) with tabu search method (TSM). The proposed model consists of a number of Crunode intelligent agents (CIAGs) and a single intelligent control agent (ICAG). These agents are co-operative and capable of interacting with each other dynamically to gain local optimal solutions. Based on that, TSM is utilized by ICAG to search for a global optimal solution. Through flexible interaction of agents and heuristic search of TSM, the optimal solution of PSR could be obtained and this is verified by simulation results. In addition, the proposed model is applicable to different electric network topologies and has the necessary flexibility of dealing with various problems during restoration.

Barg|A multi-agent architecture for cooperative query answering|Many people have considered the idea of query relaxation as a means of supplying an approximate answer when an exact match to a database query could not be found. By supplying an answer that nearly matches the original request, it is hoped that the user may still be able to find a satisfactory match. Much of the work to date, however, has not examined the different &#034;relaxation needs&#034; of different users. This paper proposes a solution by using a series of user profiling agents to extract information about the user from their patterns of searching behaviour. Information is extracted by the various agents in a mostly invisible manner, by observing the behaviour which users undertake as part of their normal searching practice. Multiple agents work in a dynamic manner, obtaining and combining their information as needed by other agents or by the system as a whole. The agents make intelligent inferences about the user and continuously seek and respond to feedback, modifying and refining their assumptions.

In this paper, we further study the leader-following consensus problem for linear discrete-time multi-agent systems subject to static networks for the case where the leader system is marginally stable.

In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy control system that is embedded in the intelligent agent which is a function agent in Multi-Agent System (MAS) based on ZigBee wireless sensor network. The system learns the user';s preferences according to the manually operation of the user and proactively controls the environment. The intelligent fuzzy agent includes four phases: (1) Capturing input-output data pairs. (2) Extracting fuzzy rules. (3) Agent control. (4). Modifying fuzzy rules online. Initially the system';s fuzzy rules are extracted from the collected information of sensors and actuators in IIEs, after that the system rapidly optimizes the fuzzy rules when the user';s preferences change. The experience results show that the proposed system is effective. Moreover, adding the time and user behaviors inputs will improve the learning accuracy of the system.

And introduce a concept &#034;pairs of roles&#034;. The other purpose is to show how to express the behavioral semantics of an agent and a multi-agent system with the &#034;state transition graph&#034;. The individual attributes of an agent consist of beliefs and intentions, and for intentions we adopt the &#034;twin-subset semantics&#034; developed by us. While the organizational attributes of an agent consist of &#034;pairs of roles&#034;. These compose the state of individual agent and the relations between agents. The state transitions are produced by the behaviors of agents and materialize the dynamic characters of agent and the turn of a multi-agent system. And the behaviors arise from the mental states of agents and the situations.
87|973536|Conference Paper|2001|Haiming Lu|TRUST!-A distributed multi-agent system for community formation and information recommendation|In centralized collaborative information recommendation, there is a bottleneck for the scalability and the availability. Yenta is a decentralized approach. Information can be recommended through the clustering. The clustering of similar agents in Yenta is based on the similarities between the content of their interest models. So the agents must represent the interests of users or the models of other agents in the same way. This paper introduces the TRUST! system. In TRUST!, the agent';s user evaluates the information recommended from other agents. The trust degree between different agents is decided by the user';s evaluation. The similarities between different agents are measured by the trust connections. So the agents can represent the interests of users or the models of other agents in different ways. TRUST! is a distributed multiagent system for Internet information propagation and recommendation. It is based on limited friends list and trust relationship. To update trust, we introduce the PID (proportion, integral, and differential coefficient) arithmetic. Through emulation experiments, we give some analysis of the distributed clustering.
87|8217007|Conference Paper|2017|Yongzhao Hua|Formation-containment tracking for high-order linear multi-agent systems on directed graphs|Formation-containment tracking problems for high-order linear multi-agent system on directed graphs are studied, where the multi-agent system is composed of a virtual leader, several real leaders and followers. The real leaders need to not only accomplish a predefined time-varying formation but also track the expected trajectory generated by the virtual leader, while the followers are required to converge to the convex hull formed by the real leaders. Firstly, a formation-containment tracking protocol is presented by using the neighboring relative information. Then an algorithm to design the control parameters is given, where the formation-containment tracking feasible constraint is proposed. Furthermore, based on the Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the multi-agent system can achieve the given formation-containment tracking under the designed protocol. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by a simulation example.

This paper describes the architectural system foundations of the European R&amp;D GO0DMAN project where a multi-agent system is developed as the mean to provide a real-time, multi-level and multi-stage approach to reach a zero-defect production system in multi-stage environments. Particularly, the paper focuses the integration of software agents and quality control stations forming smart inspection tools, aligned with the cyber-physical systems principles. The proposed approach is validated using an electrical motor testbed, where the agent-based system allows the digitization of the running testing system in a multi-stage schema.
88|8929177|Conference Paper|2019|Jonathan Leung|Goal-Oriented Modelling for Virtual Assistants|Virtual assistants are used in a wide variety of environments by different types of users. Giving users the ability to build and customize virtual assistants'; skills and capabilities would enable them to create virtual assistants that can fit the needs of different scenarios. We propose a model for virtual assistants, based on Goal Net, with the aim of empowering users without programming experience to personalize and customize their virtual assistants. Goal Net separates the design of agent mental models from their low-level implementation. Developers contribute to a library of functions which can be used designers to develop functionality for their virtual assistants. The Multi- Agent Development Environment (MADE) is a graphical tool for creating Goal Net agents and allows users to easily deploy their agents for usage without the need to compile code. A case study is performed to show how Goal Net can be used to develop virtual assistant skills. The proposed model provides a foundation for future work, which would involve human computer interaction and natural language processing.
88|4416765|Conference Paper|2007|Yu Han|A service based multi-agent system design tool for modelling integrated manufacturing and service systems|Intelligent software agent technology has wide ranging applications in automating processes that require learning and decision making. It has been demonstrated that multi-agent systems can serve the needs of a real-time distributed manufacturing environment [6]. It would be most rewarding if an integrated manufacturing and service system (IMSS) could be easily and efficiently modeled by a multi-agent system. However, although there are well established methodologies to model agent mental states, there is an absence of effective tools to convert the design into implementation. This paper proposes a service based agent system modelling and design tool - the Goal Net Designer, to bridge the gap between modeling a multi-agent system and automatically implementing the design to serve the purpose of an IMSS.

88|8866216|Conference Paper|2019|Sensen Wang|Consensus analysis for multi-agent systems with a smart leader|This paper studies the leader-following consensus problem of second-order multi-agent systems with a smart leader. The smart leader can obtain and utilize the feedback information from its neighbors to adjust the difference between the leader and the system';s desired target state and serves as a caretaker. Based on the change of communication weight among agents, a new system structure with time-varying gain is proposed. A novel consensus protocol is then designed for leader-following consensus with directed communication topology. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and the finite-time consensus method, some sufficient conditions are obtained. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated by numerical simulations. The advantages of the multi-agent system with a smart leader are provided in terms of control input, position error, and energy consumption.
88|9275247|Conference Paper|2020|Xuefang Li|Collaborative Output Tracking of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems via Observer-Based Learning Control Approach|In this work, the collaborative output tracking control of a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems is investigated under the framework of adaptive learning control, where a state observer is utilized to estimate the unmeasurable system states. By updating the individual input of each subsystem simultaneously based on the collaborative tracking error, the convergence of collaborative learning (co-learning) can be guaranteed. It is shown that with an appropriate unity partition on the derivative of desired output, the convergence of individual learning for each agent implies the convergence of co-learning. The rigorous convergence analysis of the co-learning is provided based on the composite energy function (CEF) methodology. In the end, an numerical example is illustrated to present the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

Because the existing agent systems sequentially perform a CMIS operation on selected managed objects, it cannot guarantee quick response time when many managed objects are selected. We propose a multi-threaded process structure for the agent system which performs CMIS operations concurrently on managed objects. We implemented our agent system using OSIMIS-4.O TMN platform in Solaris. We measured response time to a CMIS operation to evaluate the performance of our system. Experimental results show that the performance of our system is not so good when network resources reside within the agent system, but very good when network resources reside outside the agent system.
88|9327634|Conference Paper|2020|Yangzhou Chen|Consensus of Switched Linear Multi-agent Systems Under Arbitrary Switching Signal|This paper studies the consensus problem of homogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs), in which each agent is governed by the switched linear dynamics. It is assumed that the switching between the subsystems of the agents is arbitrary, and the communication topology contains a directed spanning tree. By utilizing the incidence matrix of a directed spanning tree to construct a transformation matrix, we make an equivalent transformation from the globally uniformly asymptotic consensus problem of the MAS to the globally uniformly asymptotic stability (GUAS) problem of a switched linear system. Then we derive some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) based sufficient conditions for ensuring the globally uniformly asymptotic consensus of the MAS, by employing the common Lyapunov function method. Furthermore, the agent agreed state value is also developed. We finally give several numerical examples to verify the correctness of the theoretical results.
88|8015300|Conference Paper|2017|Jing Ma|Cucker-smale flocking under asynchronous update dynamics|The effects of asynchronous updating of the state of the agents in a Cucker-Smale flocking model is considered in this paper. The study of asynchronous update is important because in practical implementations the agents typically have internal clocks that are not synchronized. We considered how asynchronous update will affect the time it takes to achieve flocking (flocking time) as well as how close the agents in the flock are moving (flock diameter). These factors were largely ignored in most previous works as achieving asymptotic convergence was their main focus. Furthermore, previous simulations typically assume that the agents move with the same speed. We considered the effects of achieving consensus of both the speed and the heading. Through computer simulations, we showed that both the flocking time and flock diameter increase significantly with asynchronicity. Results also showed that the diameter of the flock is substantially larger when the agents start with different speeds. These results should be taken into account when designing flocking agents in practice.

The cases with and without communication time delay are considered. In particular, if the communication time delay is not taken into account, the bipartite consensus of the multi-agent systems with directed signed graph can be achieved by the proposed distributed controller. If the communication time delay is considered, the bipartite consensus of the multi-agent systems with undirected signed graph can be achieved and the upper bound of the time delay is further derived. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the correctness of the results.

First, we propose a novel distributed intermittent event-triggered control strategy, and a sufficient criterion is obtained to guarantee the leader-following consensus of MASs by establishing a novel piecewise differential inequality. Next, the intermittent event-triggered optimal control strategy is delicately given. Remarkably, the optimality of MASs is proven based on policy iteration and the convergence of the closed-loop system is also proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Then, the intermittent event-triggered approximate optimal control strategy is designed via an actor-critic network whose weights are only updated at the trigger instants. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior can be excluded in this article. Finally, two simulation examples further verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
88|6896871|Conference Paper|2014|Youfeng Su|Multi-agent rendezvous via internal model approach|Most of the recent results on the leader-following rendezvous problem focus only on the deterministic multi-agent systems without external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. In this paper, we will present a novel distributed internal model approach to study the leader-following rendezvous problem for double-integrator multi-agent systems subject to both external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. We first give some suitable distributed internal model to convert the rendezvous problem into the stabilization problem with connectivity preserving for its augmented system. Then we stabilize the corresponding augmented system via distributed state feedback control by defining a new potential function and performing the backstepping control technique. Comparing with some recent results, our design can handle a large class of reference signals, external disturbances, and plant uncertainties.

The standard cubature Kalman filter (CKF) process is modified to make it suitable for PSHDSE execution, and software agents are utilized to receive data and run PSHDSE for the RTU and PMU measurements separately. PSHDSE is solved by utilizing the CKF, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The relative performances of the EKF, UKF, and CKF in executing PSHDSE are established through simulations on the IEEE 30 bus and practical 246-bus Indian test systems.
88|8619586|Conference Paper|2018|Bo Fan|Performance Guaranteed Control for Multi-Agent Systems with Unknown Control Directions|In this paper, a performance guaranteed control algorithm is presented for the consensus control of a class of unknown nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown control directions. It is shown that the states of agents stay within prescribed time-varying restrictions for all time. To attain these new results, an equivalent unconstrained MAS is generated from the original constrained one via a state transformation technique. Stabilization and consensus of the transformed agent states ensure both the consensus of the original agent states as well as the satisfaction of the prescribed restrictions. Based on the Nussbaum gain technique, the unknown control direction problem is solved. Consensus task is achieved theoretically via using Lyapunov synthesis, along with all the closed-loop signals being bounded. Additionally, in the proposed control design, each agent only exchanges the information with its neighbours. Hence, the proposed consensus protocol is distributed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed controller.

To deal with the heterogeneity problem, a so-called internal reference model is proposed for each agent, and the system uncertainties can be handled by utilizing the internal model principle. Then, a novel distributed event-triggered control scheme is developed. Furthermore, with the proposed control scheme, Zeno behavior can be excluded for each agent by introducing a strictly positive timer. An example is finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme.

88|7790876|Journal Article|2018|Junyong Sun|Distributed Adaptive Consensus Disturbance Rejection for Multi-Agent Systems on Directed Graphs|This paper considers the distributed consensus disturbance rejection problem for general linear multiagent systems with deterministic disturbances under directed communication graphs. Based on the relative state information of the neighboring agents, the consensus protocols, which consist of two observers, including a state observer and a separate disturbance observer, are designed to guarantee that the consensus error goes to zero with complete disturbance rejection. Furthermore, the state observer is designed in a fully distributed fashion with adaptive coupling gain, which has the advantage that the consensus controller design is independent of the Laplacian matrix associated with the communication network. The distributed observer-based consensus disturbance rejection protocols are further extended to containment control. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.
88|858518|Conference Paper|2000|M. Sridharan|Multi-agent Q-learning and regression trees for automated pricing decisions|We study the use of the reinforcement learning algorithm Q-learning with regression tree function approximation to learn pricing strategies in a competitive marketplace of economic software agents. Q-learning is an algorithm for learning to estimate the long-term expected reward for a given state-action pair. In the case of a stationary environment with a lookup table representing the Q-function, the learning procedure is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy. However, utilizing Q-learning in multi-agent systems presents special challenges. The simultaneous adaptation of multiple agents creates a non-stationary environment for each agent, hence there are no theoretical guarantees of convergence or optimality. Also, large multi-agent systems may have state spaces too large to represent with lookup tables, necessitating the use of function approximation.
88|8901055|Conference Paper|2019|Leiming Zhang|Multi-agent Pursuit-Evasion Under Uncertainties with Redundant Robot Assignments: Extended Abstract|We consider a pursuit-evasion problem with a heterogeneous team of multiple pursuers and multiple evaders. The pursuers (robots), using only noisy on-board sensors, can make a probabilistic estimation of positions of multiple moving evaders based on sensor measurements of signals emitted by the evaders. The evaders being aware of the environment and the position of all pursuers follow a strategy to actively avoid being intercepted. We model the evaders'; motion as a time-varying Markov process, and along with stochastic measurements, the pursuers use Markov Localization to update the probability distribution of the evaders. A search-based motion planning strategy is developed that intrinsically takes the probability distribution of the evaders into account. Pursuers are assigned using an assignment algorithm that takes redundancy into account, such that the estimated net time to capture the evaders is minimized. Our experimental evaluation shows that the redundant assignment algorithm performs better than an alternative nearest-neighbor based assignment algorithm.

Van Sickel|Distributed Discrete Event and Pseudo Real-Time Combined Simulation for Multi-Agent Controlled Power Plants|Development, testing, simulation, and validation of complex real-time distributed systems is a challenge on many levels. Designing multi-agent systems for power plant control can be approached numerous ways, but it is important to enhance the flow of development to implementation. Using new Distributed Real-time Agent Framework with Time-warp (DRAFT) agents can enhance the development of multi-agent systems. Discrete event simulation allows a fast as possible simulation and forces synchronization while guaranteeing all tasks are accomplished on time to assist with initial stages of development when it is more important to focus on larger design concepts. The DRAFT agents can switch over to standard operation and operate on psuedo real-time or real-time environments to further develop all aspects of a multi-agent system with real-time requirements. It also gives the agents self simulation capabilities that could be used to enhance overall functionality of the multi-agent system.

The two types of impulsive protocols are proposed for the case without and with leader agent. Edge event-triggered technique is presented, where for each communication link, occurrence of edge event can activate the mutual state sampling and controller update of the corresponding agents. The control approach combines the characteristics of impulsive control and edge event-triggered control and is defined as ‚Äúimpulsive edge event-triggered control.‚Äù It has good performance in robustness against disturbance and reduces the communication cost. The results with the aid of the Lyapunov function approach and stability theory of impulsive control show that if some sufficient conditions are satisfied, the consensus of MASs can be guaranteed and the rate of convergence can be exponentially estimated. Additionally, Zeno-behavior can be eliminated by using impulsive edge event-triggered control, which reduces the burden of event detectors. Finally, two simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our theoretical analysis.

89|6039152|Conference Paper|2011|Arangamanikkannan Manickam|Intelligent multi-agent framework for power system control and protection|In this paper, we propose a multi-agent methodology (MAM) for power system monitoring and protection. The uniqueness of the proposed architecture is the ability of MAM to evolve in the wake of an attack of malicious intent by mutation and thus always monitoring a power system bus remotely. Also, the architecture interacts with the mutated agents use a voting methodology thus alleviating the effect of agent malfunction in the presence of attack. This architecture also enables inter-agent communication which makes a collaborative framework and increases the degree of fault tolerance and leads to immediate problem solving. This architecture is tested on a two area network with five equivalent generators and 8 bus power networks for abnormal condition detection, generator bus isolation and also restoring power to the area which is affected by the bus isolation. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed methodology is capable of not only detecting the power grid attack but can also continuously monitor and isolate the generator bus even in the presence of sustained attack as the agents are regenerated.

We propose a setup for the interconnected agents to achieve output synchronization with event-driven communication in the presence of constant communication delays. The results presented here are important extensions of applying event-driven communication to control of multi-agent systems, especially when it is difficult to derive a common upper bound on the admissible network induced delays, or when the network induced delays between coupled agents are larger than the inter-event time implicitly determined by the event-triggering condition.

The algorithm, which is derived from the cross coupling design and consensus theory, enables cooperative robots to accomplish a shared task and to compensate the communication time delay existence. Besides, the stability analysis of the SMC with synchronization of time delay multi-robot systems has been proved. Simulation results performed on a cooperative multi-agent system with constant communication time delays have illustrated good and satisfactory performances which verify the effectiveness of the SMC synchronizing algorithm and theoretical analysis.

Manickavasagam|Control of distributed generator and smart grid using multi-agent system|The electric power system is an enabling infrastructure that supports the operation of other critical infrastructures and thus the economic well being of the nation. It is therefore very important to design a smart grid for resiliency and autonomous re-configurability in the electric power grid. For the operation of any power system, its control architecture consisting of hardware and software protocols is very essential for exchanging system status and control signals. This is accomplished by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Current trends to control and monitor the operation of electric power systems are however moving towards the use of an automated agent technology using a multi-agent system which replaces SCADA system. The objective of this paper is to design and model a multiagent system which consists of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) agent, Data Base agent, Control agent and User agent. DER agent is modeled using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulation results presented in this paper show the seamless transition from grid connected to an island mode when upstream outages are detected. This denotes the capability of a multi-agent system as a technology for managing the microgrid operation.

A new distributed protocol with hybrid constant and time-varying feedbacks of local signed error is proposed, whose consensus time period is independent of the specific topology among agents and initial states of all agents. By introducing a series of well-structured Lyapunov functions, the technical difficulties arising from the asymmetrical Laplacian matrices of directed graphs are circumvented. The effectiveness of this prescribed-time protocol for multi-agent systems on signed digraphs with a spanning tree is proven both on structurally balanced digraphs and structurally unbalanced ones with a positive root subgraph. An illustrative simulation example and a prescribed-time bipartite formation experiment on a swarm of nano-quadcopters are implemented to show the validity and practicability of these proposed protocols.

The necessary and sufficient conditions on the allowable upper bounds of the constant feedback gain and the sampling period are derived. Comparison simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

In order to guarantee the state constraints are satisfied, an appropriate asymmetric nonlinear mapping (NM) is employed to transform the original full state constrained system into a corresponding unconstrained one. Combining neural networks technology, graph theory, fast finite-time control theory and backstepping recursive design scheme, the uncertainties and non-strict-feedback form are considered to propose a distributed adaptive FTC protocol which can guarantee tracking error reaching a region in finite time. Finally, an example is given to show that the designed control law can perform effective control.
89|7856249|Conference Paper|2016|M. Chen|Distributed negotiation in future power networks: Rapid prototyping using multi-agent system|Technologies like multi-agent system (MAS) have the capability to deal with future power grid requirements such as frequency management and voltage control under a flexible, intelligent and active feature. Based on web of cells (WoC) architecture proposed by European Liaison on Electricity Committed Towards longer-term Research Activity Integrated Research Programme (ELECTRA IRP), a distributed MAS with distributed negotiation ability for future distributed control (including frequency management and voltage control) is proposed. Each cell is designed as an intelligent agent and is investigated in case studies with constraints, where each agent can only communicate with its neighbouring agents. The interaction logic among agents is according to the distributed negotiation algorithm under consideration by the authors. Simulation results indicate that the WoC architecture could negotiate resources in a distributed manner and achieve successful exchange of resources by coordinating distributed agents. Moreover, the prototype reported in this paper can be extended further for future grids'; distributed control regimes. The option of MAS to be exploited for the support of the development and integration of novel power system concepts is explored.
89|7554567|Conference Paper|2016|Yong Yang|Hybrid triggering control for average consensus of multi-agent systems|This paper investigate the event-triggered consensus problem for multi-agent systems in the average consensus case. An event of each agent is triggered only when certain measurement error reaches some prescribed threshold. Then at each event time instant, each agent communicates with its neighbors, sends information to them and then updates its controller. In the event design in this work, we use discontinuous threshold and as a result, the continuous communication among agents is avoided. This may reduce energy consumption in practice. To exclude the Zeno behavior, we propose an event/time hybrid triggering scheme. Then asymptotic consensus can be guaranteed while the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is then extended to a self-triggered case and thus continuous self-state monitoring can be further avoided. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulation examples.

Jena|Digital licensing service for agents and Web services|If agent systems are to scale, many individuals and organizations across the Web will own agents and/or may want to rent, lease and otherwise license the capabilities of agents or groups of agents. This paper focuses on identifying a collection of services that are aimed at automating the digital licensing of agent-based services. The digital licensing service is itself a composite service consisting of a collection of subservices. A negotiation service results in a contract between two parties. The terms and conditions of the contract are monitored by a digital rights management service. A compensation service handles payment. An electronic receipt service handles compensation bookkeeping. Other more traditional services are assumed, including a discovery service, a binding service, a workflow service, and security services. Since we represent our agent and service interfaces using Web service description language and also our digital licensing services, our scheme is being developed to be upwards compatible with Web services.

Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method and verify the obtained results.

Swarm intelligence receives high attention in recent years. Stigmergy is an important mechanism for swarm intelligence. This article deliberately studies animal swarm intelligence and their stigmergy mechanism, and applies these principles to multi-agent system study. Firstly, we establish a stigmergy agent model, which is a general architecture, based on stigmergy mechanism and animal task allocation method. Then extended stigmergy architecture is put forward based on Stigmergy Agent architecture, adding direct contact between agents to general stigmergy architecture, which extends the stigmergy application domain. At last we introduce swarm intelligence based multi-agent system, and put forward improved bipartite graph to analysis the multi-agent organization architecture. Some application research directions are also discussed in this article.

The pure-feedback MASs are transformed into strict-feedback form by using the mean value theorem. The reinforcement learning approach is applied to handle the unknown functions and system control performance index. Moreover, the error terms are introduced to the controller, which can improve the robust of the control scheme. The theoretical analysis indicates that all the signals and tracking errors in close-loop system are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), and the numerical simulation are conducted to verify the superiority of this scheme.

Martins|A literature review of security mechanisms employed by mobile agents|This paper performs a survey on the state of the art in the security and access controls mechanisms employed by multi agent systems as a form of data transaction, with special emphasis on their security threats and how these issues are currently being tackled for multi-agent systems. In this paper we provide a brief summary of current approaches and provide comments on their relevance, implementation and safety assumptions behind their safe operation on real systems with sensitive data. We also take special notice on the security issues approached by each one of the analysed proposals and the sometimes ingenious ways proposed by different authors to solve them. We also pay special attention to issues related with the authentication, confidentiality, integrity and access control mechanisms employed to minimise security incidents. Nowadays multi-agent systems are increasingly being researched and deployed to solve complex interoperability issues that normally occur between different institutions. The final result of this survey is a summary aggregation of knowledge about security and access control practices for multi agent models and implementations.

As resource unavailability may be unknown in advance in some periods of the project in reality, an agent-based dynamic solution for RCPSP with task splitting and uncertain resource supply is provided to solve this problem, the essence of which is to dynamically adjusting the key tasks of the project in accordance with the tasks'; time lags mainly caused by the uncertain resource supply. Besides, interruption of running tasks is allowed since it conforms to reality. A multi-agent system consisting of several agents and one resource agent is exploited to illustrate its performance. Lastly the experimental results illustrate the efficiency of dynamic solution.

In contrast to the existing distributed methods that require global information of the interaction graph, the proposed control strategy is fully distributed such that each agent only requires its own information and the information from its neighbors through switching directed communication networks. Then, an algorithm to determine the control parameters is presented, where feasible formation condition for the followers to accomplish the desired time-varying formation tracking is provided. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is also guaranteed to achieve an optimal control performance index by using the inverse optimal approach. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Based on the MAS frame model, independent software units are wrapped to agents, and their integration logic is described by the script language. Through explaining the file, the collaboration of multi-agent is under control. Dialogue expansion contract net protocol is used for the cooperation when agent cannot solve problems by itself. In order to achieve the aim of flexible and dynamic integration, new wrapped agents can be added into MAS dynamically and the edited script can be explained by the parser. Finally, the agent-based system integration tools is built upon this frame model, and an application of this model about the border and coast defense system is presented, which verifies the rationality, feasibility and efficiency.
