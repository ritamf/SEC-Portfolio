The system utilizes the data from SCADA and fault information system. Based on the integrated data source, a model of agent living environment is presented. More researches are focused on architecture of multi-agent system and cooperative strategy of agents. Finally, a MAS-based decision support system (MASDSS) is established. The application shows MASDSS more advantageous than individual agent in the sides of integrated solving problems, cooperative control and information share.

The method is developed based on the performance index regarding the consensus behavior with respect to the agent state differences and the control efforts of the agents. By using the Taylor expansion method, an analytical distributed near-optimal controller is presented for solving the optimal consensus problem. A simulative example is presented to demonstrate the performance of the method.

Unlike most existing works of finite-time consensus, we focus on nonlinear multi-agent systems with lower triangular subsystems. Based on the local cooperative information among neighboring agents, we propose a tracking consensus protocol ensuring that all agents achieve consensus in a finite time. Finally, we give an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.

In particular, a method to select the best interfacing practice for a given application scenario, defined by the user, from a set of available interfacing templates and technologies, aiming to improve reuse, consistency, and transparency in the integration of industrial agents and low-level control functions, is defined.

The desired trajectory is constructed by introducing a virtual leader, and the fixed communication topology is considered and only a subset of followers can access the desired trajectory. For each control scheme, one controller is designed for one agent individually. According to the tracking error between the agent and the virtual leader, and the tracking errors between the agent and neighboring agents during the last iteration (for open-loop scheme) or the current running (for closed-loop scheme), each controller continuously corrects the last control law by a combination of communication weights in the topology to obtain the ideal control law. Through the rigorous analysis, sufficient conditions for both control schemes are established to ensure that all agents can achieve the asymptotically consistent output along the iteration axis within a finite-time interval. Sufficient numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control schemes, and provide some meaningful comparison results.

Those models have considerably forwarded the domain by different paradigms to improving MAS development process. However, they have totally omitted real-time constraints, important aspects for Real-Time Multi-Agent Systems (RTMAS) construction. In this paper, we present a survey on MAS organizational models and an extension of AUML diagrams to describing Real-Time Multi-Agent Systems (RTMAS) organizational requirements. The proposed approach considers jointly functional, static and dynamic aspects of RTMAS. The aim is to combine the advantages of AUML and the organizational concepts extracted from the study of five agent organization methodologies in a single technique, since the analysis phase.
